Context: The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in risk for cardiovascular disease; however, whether variability in reproductive aging relates to cardiovascular risk factors in the premenopausal period has not been studied. Controversy still exists as to the relative importance of menopausal status and lifestyle factors for the risk of coronary heart disease in women. Most of the studies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in menopause have focused on serum lipid(lipoprotein) abnormalities and were conducted in populations which were not well controlled for several important influential factors. This study examines whether patterns of worries about aging change in women during the menopausal transition. It has been widely known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is increased in menopause. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether this risk was elevated in young women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR).

To evaluate the role of body mass index (BMI) in women with premenopausal heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) to identify patients who should undergo endometrial biopsy. To evaluate whether body mass index (BMI) is an independent risk factor for survival in patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to correlate the body mass index with transvaginal sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness in a cohort of postmenopausal women who were admitted for endometrial cancer surveillance. The purpose of this study was to review the effect of age and body mass index (BMI) on the prognosis, demographic characteristics, and pathological features of patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer, specifically before menopause. To evaluate whether a model to predict a failed endometrial biopsy in women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) and a thickened endometrium can reduce costs without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

Hormone replacement therapy is associated with both reflux symptoms and oesophagitis. During pregnancy, elevated sex hormones are thought to contribute to the high prevalence of reflux symptoms. Increased female sex hormone levels may thus contribute to the aetiology of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).AIM: To determine if female sex hormone levels are associated with symptomatic acid reflux. Women with GORD symptoms undergoing oesophageal pH monitoring were prospectively recruited. 'Cases' and 'controls' were defined by normal and excess total acid exposure on pH monitoring and were age-matched and BMI-matched. Case and control groups were further stratified into premenopausal and postmenopausal groups. Demographic data were collected, body morphological parameters were measured and oestradiol, oestrone, progesterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) occurs in 30-50% of all pregnancies. The progressive rise in plasma progesterone has been suggested as a possible mediator of GER during pregnancy. It is not known whether progesterone, at physiological concentrations, has an effect on acid contact time. We sought to evaluate the relationship between progesterone concentrations, lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), and acid contact time across the normal menstrual cycle. Obesity is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer.

Context: Obesity constitutes a clear risk factor for cholelithiasis, especially if it is associated with a rapid weight loss, as is the case of patients following bariatric surgery. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is indicated in biliopancreatic diversions due to the high incidence of postoperative cholelithiasis. However, there is no agreement on gastric bypass. This study was conducted to establish the incidence of cholecystopathy demonstrated by histology and to assess the indication for prophylactic cholecystectomy in a systematic way on patients undergoing gastric bypass. The preoperative investigation for choledocholithiasis in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still a matter of debate. To evaluate the efficacy, long-term outcome, and safety of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) in high-risk surgical patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risks and benefits of concurrent prophylactic cholecystectomy (CPC) during laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). No unanimous consensus has been reached as to the need for routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) after endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) for choledocholithiasis in very elderly patients, who are considered as high-risk subjects for surgery.

Context: Vulvar carcinomas (VC) and vulvar in situ cancers (VCIS) are rare genital malignancies. Total vulvectomy as the standard of care has been replaced by local excision during the early stages of the disease. We studied whether conservation of the clitoris in vulvar surgery has a positive effect on either the quality of life (QoL) or the sexual sensation of the patient. To evaluate the impact of radiotherapy after limited surgery in vulvar carcinoma. Between May 2000 and November 2004, twenty-three patients with locally advanced or relapsed vulvar carcinoma underwent major radical or extended vulvectomy, requiring reconstructive surgery. A consistent protocol for the perioperative management of these patients, including precautionary measures to reduce the rate of early complications, was introduced in the second study period (from November 2003) to verify the benefit on surgical outcome. Between March 1980 and January 2000, 22 patients older than 60 years and suffering from invasive vulvar carcinoma were treated with limited surgery and radiotherapy at Gülhane Military Medicine Academy. These are the subjects of this review. The aim of this study was to characterize the means whereby the results could be improved and the morbidity and side-effects minimized, of radical and extensive surgery performed together with plastic reconstruction, in the treatment of locally advanced and relapsed vulvar carcinoma. Vulvar carcinomas (VC) and vulvar in situ cancers (VCIS) are rare genital malignancies. Total vulvectomy as the standard of care has been replaced by local excision during the early stages of the disease. We studied whether conservation of the clitoris in vulvar surgery has a positive effect on either the quality of life (QoL) or the sexual sensation of the patient. To evaluate the impact of radiotherapy after limited surgery in vulvar carcinoma. Between May 2000 and November 2004, twenty-three patients with locally advanced or relapsed vulvar carcinoma underwent major radical or extended vulvectomy, requiring reconstructive surgery. A consistent protocol for the perioperative management of these patients, including precautionary measures to reduce the rate of early complications, was introduced in the second study period (from November 2003) to verify the benefit on surgical outcome.

Reoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is feasible in patients with local recurrence (LR) of invasive breast cancer but it remains unclear if this procedure affects either treatment or outcome. In this study, we ask whether axillary restaging (vs. none) at the time of LR affects the rate of subsequent events: axillary failure (AF), non-axillary recurrence (NAR), distant metastasis, or death. To determine the feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping in local and in-transit recurrent melanoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of performing a selective intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients. Lymphatic mapping techniques have the potential of changing the standard of surgical care of breast cancer patients. This paper reports a prospective study documenting the safety and efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy in 167 breast cancer patients and reviews the world literature on the procedure. Re-operative surgery is stressful for patients and is an additional burden to an already stretched public health system. Intraoperative confirmation of breast cancer metastases in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) provides the necessary information for the surgeon to proceed with immediate axillary dissection, avoiding the need for a second operation, its associated cost, morbidity and adjuvant treatment delays. Our challenge was to implement a technique that was rapid, inexpensive and had a negligible false positive rate. The aim of this study was to determine whether touch imprint cytology (TIC) could reduce returns to theatre without compromising patient safety and pathology department and operating theatre efficiency.

Patients with secondary peritonitis often require relaparotomy; however, there is no consensus about the criteria for selecting patients who would benefit from early relaparotomy. Our goal was to evaluate whether elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during the early postoperative period could predict the need for relaparotomy. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of peritoneal drainage (PD) on postoperative infective complications in cases with perforated appendicitis. The aim of this study was to assess laparoscopic lavage in controlling abdominal sepsis secondary to purulent peritonitis. This is a four-year prospective analysis from January 2005 to December 2008 of 20 patients requiring TNP following laparotomy for severe peritonitis. A recent study demonstrated that negative-pressure wound therapy increases underlying tissue pressure. This finding is incongruous with studies using laser Doppler that show that perfusion is immediately increased on initiation of suction.

Current evidence suggests that local anesthetic wound infiltration should be employed as part of multimodal postoperative pain management. There is scarce data concerning the benefits of this anesthetic modality in laparoscopic weight loss surgery. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of trocar site infiltration with bupivacaine on the management of postoperative pain in laparoscopic bariatric surgery. This retrospective randomized study included 47 patients undergoing primary obesity surgery between January and September 2014. Laparoscopic gastric bypass was performed in 39 cases and sleeve gastrectomy in 8 cases. Patients were stratified into two groups depending on whether preincisional infiltration with bupivacaine and epinephrine was performed (study group, 27 patients) or not (control group, 20 patients).

Context: People with limited health literacy are more likely to be socioeconomically disadvantaged and have risk factors for preventable chronic diseases. General practice is the ideal setting to address these inequalities however these patients engage less in preventive activities and experience difficulties navigating health services. This study aimed to compare primary care patients with and without sufficient health literacy in terms of their lifestyle risk factors, and explore factors associated with receiving advice and referral for these risk factors from their GPs. Almost half of Canadians experience difficulty using print media, according to the 1994 International Adult Literacy Survey. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of low-literacy patients in our practice, to determine whether reading grade level is associated with self-perceived health status in primary care, and to evaluate the reading difficulty of commonly used patient education pamphlets. A large proportion of US adults struggle with limited literacy skills, which affect their ability to fully function in health care settings. This study evaluated the readability of English language American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) patient education materials.

University-conducted primary care study. To examine differences in the effect of coronary heart disease (CHD) on health functioning according to socioeconomic position. Research on social inequality in health has tended to concentrate on differences in disease prevalence and mortality rather than on the impact of disease on functioning. As outcomes improve for those with CHD, it is important to know how their health is affected in the long term. To examine whether socioeconomic status and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors remain significant predictors of CHD among people aged>or=65 years. Previous studies in this age group are few and inconsistent. The independent influence of childhood social circumstances on health in later life remains uncertain. We examined the extent to which childhood socio-economic circumstances are related to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in older British men, taking account of adult social class and behavioural risk factors. To estimate the extent to which changes in blood pressure, smoking, and serum cholesterol concentration explain the observed increase in socioeconomic differences in mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in Finland during the past 20 years. A clear socioeconomic pattern was found in two year coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality: the lower the socioeconomic group the higher the mortality risk. The socioeconomic patterning of mortality was similar to that found among MI patients. Controlling for comorbidity or disease severity did not change the results. Among AP patients a similar pattern was also found in MI incidence during the follow up, but no systematic socioeconomic differences were detected in its 28 day case fatality.

Cannabis use has been identified as a potent predictor of the earlier onset of psychosis, but meta-analysis has not indicated that it has a clear effect in established psychosis.AIM: To assess the association between cannabis and outcomes, including whether change in cannabis use affects symptoms and functioning, in a large sample of people with established nonaffective psychosis and comorbid substance misuse. To assess the extent to which ceasing the use of cannabis or other substances reduces the symptoms and social disability associated with psychotic illness. Cannabis use is considered a component cause of psychotic illness, interacting with genetic and other environmental risk factors. Little is known, however, about these putative interactions. The present study investigated whether an urban environment plays a role in moderating the effects of adolescent cannabis use on psychosis risk. Why patients with psychosis use cannabis remains debated. The self-medication hypothesis has received some support but other evidence points towards an alleviation of dysphoria model. This study investigated the reasons for cannabis use in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and whether strength in their endorsement changed over time. Although cannabis use among individuals with psychotic disorder is considerable, little is known about patterns of use and factors contributing to continuation of use. Therefore, we investigated craving in relation to cannabis use in patients with psychotic disorder and healthy controls.

Context: Epidemiological observations suggest links between osteoporosis and risk of acute cardiovascular events and vice versa. Whether the two clinical conditions are linked by common pathogenic factors or atherosclerosis per se remains incompletely understood. We investigated whether serum lipids and polymorphism in the ApoE gene modifying serum lipids could be a biological linkage. Significantly increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women is linked with the fall of oestrogen. Although supraphysiological levels of oestrogen may inhibit oxygen free radical mediated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, the effect of physiological level of oestrogen on LDL oxidation is unknown. Most of the studies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in menopause have focused on serum lipid(lipoprotein) abnormalities and were conducted in populations which were not well controlled for several important influential factors. In this cross sectional study we enrolled 173 women in menopause (101 osteoporotic and 72 normal). In each subject the authors evaluated BMD, bone turnover, lipid profile (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein [LDL]and triglycerides), and risk factors for osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases and eating habits using a questionnaire. Our objective was to investigate whether an observed inverse association between bone mineral density (BMD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) in postmenopausal women currently taking estrogen therapy is mediated by osteoprotegerin (OPG) or receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL).

Although all clinical variants are associated with HHV-8 infection, specific differences in the clinical onset and in the natural history of AIDS-KS and Classic-KS have been described. The present randomised prospective-observational study aimed to investigate whether the ultrasound pattern and color Doppler flow imaging of vascularisation of skin lesions of patients with Classic KS (CKS) or AIDS-KS could provide useful information to the evaluation of clinical activity of the disease. The B-mode ultrasound patterns of skin lesions did not differ when comparing CKS patients to AIDS-KS patients, whereas the color Doppler signal, which is associated with vascular activity, was detected in the KS lesions of 6/8 AIDS-KS patients (75.0%) and in 2/16 CKS (16,7%); the latter two patients showed a clinically progressive and extensive disease stage (IV B). Cutaneous lesions of 24 patients with histologically confirmed KS were investigated using very high frequency ultrasound probes; 16 patients had CKS and 8 had AIDS-KS.

Hydrocephalus secondary to tuberculous meningitis (TBM) continues to be a challenging condition to treat for neurosurgeons in developing countries. Shunt complications are reportedly more frequent in patients undergoing ventriculo-peritoneal shunt in patients with TBM than in those undergoing shunt surgeries for other causes.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition on shunt malfunction. We compared the CSF composition of 53 patients who had shunt malfunction during a five year period with that of 137 matched controls. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is the current mainstay of treatment for children with tuberculous meningitis with hydrocephalus. However, ventriculoperitoneal shunting is highly associated with complications, and more importantly, long-term, indwelling shunt devices may adversely affect children's spirits and psychological health. Therefore, there is clearly a need to explore methods of CSF diversion to avoid ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Patients who had shunt malfunction had a significantly higher concentration of CSF protein. The CSF cellularity and glucose concentration did not have any significant bearing in predicting shunt malfunction. Patients with CSF protein concentration of more than 200 mg/dL had a four times higher risk of having shunt malfunction than those with a concentration of less than 100 mg/dL. Patients with CSF protein in the 100-200 mg/dL range represent an intermediate zone.

12,Does quantifying epicardial and intrathoracic fat with noncontrast computed tomography improve risk stratification beyond calcium scoring alone?,"Q: Does quantifying epicardial and intrathoracic fat with noncontrast computed tomography improve risk stratification beyond calcium scoring alone?
Context: Noncontrast cardiac computed tomography allows calculation of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and measurement of epicardial adipose tissue (EATv) and intrathoracic fat (ITFv) volumes. It is unclear whether fat volume information contributes to risk stratification. Coronary artery calcium score, traditionally based on electrocardiography (ECG)-triggered computed tomography (CT), predicts cardiovascular risk. However, nontriggered CT is extensively utilized. The study-purpose is to evaluate the in vitro agreement in coronary calcium score between nontriggered thoracic CT and ECG-triggered cardiac CT. To investigate whether aortic atherosclerosis or epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume on multidetector computed tomography (CT) can predict the presence of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the extent of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) thickness or the presence of descending thoracic aortic calcification on multi-detector CT (MDCT) can predict the presence of significant coronary artery stenosis in patients with negative coronary artery calcium (CAC). Evaluate the significance of coronary arteries calcifications detected using contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CECCT) scans.

We found for the first time that in maintenance hemodialysis patients, higher sclerostin serum level was associated with severe abdominal aortic calcification (AAC). In addition, cortical bone microarchitecture (density and thickness) assessed by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) at tibia was also independently associated with severe AAC. These results suggest that sclerostin may be involved in the association of mineral and bone disorder with vascular calcification in hemodialysis patients. Sclerostin, secreted by osteocytes, plays a key role in antagonizing bone formation. Recent studies, which seldom include chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, have reported on the association of sclerostin and mortality, with contradictory results. The assay-linked variability may contribute to these discrepant results. Severe abdominal aortic calcifications are predictive of high cardiovascular mortality in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. In patients with end-stage renal disease, a high aortic calcification score was associated with lower bone turnover on bone biopsies. Thus, we hypothesized that sclerostin, a Wnt pathway inhibitor mainly secreted by osteocytes and acting on osteoblasts to reduce bone formation, may be associated with vascular calcifications in MHD patients. Derangements in bone metabolism and vascular calcification (VC) substantially contribute to the accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD). The Wnt signalling pathway is increasingly recognized to play an important role in bone homeostasis and VC. Circulating levels of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin are elevated in CKD patients. The present study investigated whether the circulating levels of sclerostin are associated with all-cause mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients.

Context: In the past decade studies have documented substantial suffering among children dying of cancer, prompting national attention on the quality of end-of-life care and the development of a palliative care service in our institutions. We sought to determine whether national and local efforts have led to changes in patterns of care, advanced care planning, and symptom control among children with cancer at the end of life. Despite advances in the treatment of childhood cancer, some children continue to die from their disease. This study aimed to assess the impact of specialist paediatric palliative care services (SPPCSs) on the number of hospital admissions in children who subsequently died from cancer in Yorkshire, UK. In a multi-centre retrospective study we analyse all paediatric emergency medical care cases of four emergency sites over a 24-month period. In particular, all cases of acute palliative care in terminal paediatric cancer patients up to the age of 14 were evaluated. Palliative care is being advocated for noncancer patients but needs evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. It is not known whether unmet palliative care needs are associated with an interest in palliative care services among patients with advanced cancer receiving ongoing oncology care.

To utilize Aday and Andersen's Framework for the Study of Access to examine racial disparity within the State-Federal vocational rehabilitation system, among clients with brain injury. Research questions included: Do pre-disposing characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, gender, marital status and education influence vocational rehabilitation acceptance rates in the US? Do enabling characteristics such as referral source, insurance coverage and primary source of support at application influence vocational rehabilitation acceptance rates in the US? Is there a difference, based on race, in the reason for case closure for vocational rehabilitation services? Descriptive findings are presented. Of the pre-disposing factors, the most significant predictor of acceptance rate was education level. Pearson Chi-square analyses revealed significant differences between White and non-White clients with brain injury with regard to reason for closure. Black patients tend to have a greater number and severity of stroke cases.

Context: The exact role of Helicobacter pylori as a causative agent of gastric cancer is still under debate. The aim of this study was to determine how the use of different diagnostic methods for detection of H. pylori influences the measures of prevalence of the infection and thus the association with risk of gastric adenocarcinoma. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Several studies have indicated that the association differs with strain type. We aimed to find out if infection with strains lacking the virulence factor CagA is linked to gastric cancer risk. This pilot study was carried out to determine whether Helicobacter pylori can be detected in normal colon or in association with colorectal neoplasia. To determine whether H. pylori eradication treatment can reduce the risk for gastric cancer. To assess the frequency of gastric cancer patients having received eradication treatment of Helicobacter pylori, and whether this treatment has any influence on the delay in the diagnosis or the stage of the tumours at the time of the operation.

Title: DNA Vaccines—How Far From Clinical Use?
Passage: Compared to conventional protein/peptide-based vaccines intended to induce antigen-specific adaptive immune responses, DNA vaccines are more stable, cost-efficient, easy to manufacture and safe in handling . DNA vaccines are being investigated for various applications including therapy of cancer , allergies , autoimmune and infectious diseases . In the US, at the moment over 500 clinical trials that focus on DNA vaccination are registered, targeting especially viral infections and cancer , while bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases are less of a topic. The high number of DNA-vaccines tested in clinical trials emphasizes their important role for future medical approaches. This review Title: DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites: Advances and Challenges
Passage: Also, a few studies provided interesting comparisons of the same antigens administered as recombinant protein or DNA vaccines and showed that the latter were overall more effective than their recombinant protein counterparts. Indeed, DNA vaccines were able to induce a stronger Th1 bias in the immune response, a longer-lasting immunity, and/or a better protection against disease progression . While most of these studies have used a rather artificial infectious challenge based on the injection via nonnatural routes of high parasite doses, an experimental system criticized by some authors, the superior efficacy of DNA vaccines was also observed using a low-dose Title: Polyvalent DNA Vaccines Expressing HA Antigens of H5N1 Influenza Viruses with an Optimized Leader Sequence Elicit Cross-Protective Antibody Responses
Passage: recent studies , a DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost is highly effective in eliciting higher protective immune responses than using either DNA or inactivated flu vaccine alone. Therefore, it may be possible to use DNA vaccines as the first dose of immunization that can be given either long before the pandemic or shortly after the outbreak, to reduce the burden on the production of inactivated vaccines at the time of the outbreak. Furthermore, DNA vaccines can be stockpiled for a long period of time, which makes this method even more attractive. Title: DNA Vaccines: Developing New Strategies against Cancer
Passage: DNA vaccines offer the opportunity to incorporate additional genes encoding molecules aimed at overcoming the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens and the patients' tolerized immune repertoire. Title: Vaccines for the future: learning from human immunology
Passage: Although the RV144 trial has shown the benefit of a primeboost strategy for a preventive vaccine against HIV, it is still not clear which are the effector mechanisms elicited by the vaccine that protected some of the subjects from HIV infection. For difficult intracellular pathogens such as HIV and HCV, protection probably arises from the integration of different effector mechanisms of the appropriate quality. Therefore, the development of a vaccine that can be used to protect against a broad range of pathogens is a promising area of research. Title: DNA vaccines: a new approach to the treatment of cancer

DNA vaccines are being investigated for various applications including therapy of cancer , allergies , autoimmune and infectious diseases . In the US, at the moment over 500 clinical trials that focus on DNA vaccination are registered, targeting especially viral infections and cancer , while bacterial infections and autoimmune diseases are less of a topic. The high number of DNA-vaccines tested in clinical trials emphasizes their important role for future medical approaches. This review', 'Title: DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites: Advances and Challenges\nPassage: Also, a few studies provided interesting comparisons of the same antigens administered as recombinant protein or DNA vaccines and showed that the latter were overall more effective than their recombinant protein counterparts. Indeed, DNA vaccines were able to induce a stronger Th1 bias in the immune response, a longer-lasting immunity, and/or a better protection against disease progression . While most of these studies have used a rather artificial infectious challenge based on the injection via nonnatural routes of high parasite doses, an experimental system criticized by some authors, the superior efficacy of DNA vaccines was also observed using a low-dose', 'Title: Polyvalent DNA Vaccines Expressing HA Antigens of H5N1 Influenza Viruses with an Optimized Leader Sequence Elicit Cross-Protective Antibody Responses\nPassage: recent studies , a DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost is highly effective in eliciting higher protective immune responses than using either DNA or inactivated flu vaccine alone. Therefore, it may be possible to use DNA vaccines as the first dose of immunization that can be given either long before the pandemic or shortly after the outbreak, to reduce the burden on the production of inactivated vaccines at the time of the outbreak. Furthermore, DNA vaccines can be stockpiled for a long period of time, which makes this method even more attractive.', ""Title: DNA Vaccines: Developing New Strategies against Cancer\nPassage: DNA vaccines offer the opportunity to incorporate additional genes encoding molecules aimed at overcoming the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens and the patients' tolerized immune repertoire."", 'Title: Vaccines for the future: learning from human immunology\nPassage: Although the RV144 trial has shown the benefit of a primeboost strategy for a preventive vaccine against HIV, it is still not clear which are the effector mechanisms elicited by the vaccine that protected some of the subjects from HIV infection. For difficult intracellular pathogens such as HIV and HCV, protection probably arises from the integration of different effector mechanisms of the appropriate quality. Therefore, correlates of protection are not easily measured by simple antibody or T cell assays, but require more complex readouts. With the progress of genomics it is possible to generate a lot of high-throughput data from', 'Title: A review of Phase I trials of Ebola virus vaccines: what can we learn from the race to develop novel vaccines?\nPassage: readily measured also play key roles in protection . It is likely that the mechanism of protection and protective level of a particular immune component may well differ in an experimental model in NHPs, challenged in a manner that may not accurately reflect natural exposure and in humans exposed to natural infection. This highlights the importance of not being over-reliant on immunological correlates derived from pre-clinical testing. Clearly, different vaccine delivery methods induce qualitatively different immune responses; induction of long-lasting humoral immunity in the absence of T cells seems unlikely, so the ability of prime-boost regimens to induce durable CMI', 'Title: Clinical vaccine development\nPassage: example .

Patients with a fatal outcome have a weak or absent antibody response, and Ozturk et al found significant differences between IgM and IgG levels in fatal vs. non-fatal cases . However, other studies were unable to find a significant relationship between the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies and clinical outcome, but found that viral load was a better predictor of prognosis .

The viral load in lung aspirates was independent of fatality. In contrast, among the Spanish patients , 93% and 57% of the mild and critical cases respectively were positive for serum viral RNA, with no significant difference in the viral load.

Where the biological samples are taken from also play a role in the sensitivity of these tests. For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, specimens collected from the lower respiratory tract such as sputum and tracheal aspirates have higher and more prolonged levels of viral RNA because of the tropism of the virus. MERS-CoV viral loads are also higher for severe cases and have longer viral shedding compared to mild cases.

Compared to the detection of viral genome through molecular methods, serological testing detects antibodies and antigens. There would be a lag period as antibodies specifically targeting the virus would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset . Furthermore, studies suggest that low antibody titers in the second week or delayed antibody production could be associated with mortality with a high viral load.

17,Do patients with schizophrenia consciously recollect emotional events better than neutral events?,"Q: Do patients with schizophrenia consciously recollect emotional events better than neutral events?
Context: People exposed to trauma often experience intrusive thoughts and memories about that event. Research examining people's responses to trauma assumes that people can accurately notice the occurrence of symptoms. However, we know from the broader cognitive literature on 'mind-wandering' that people are not always aware of their current focus of attention. That lack of awareness has implications for our theoretical and practical understanding of how trauma survivors recover from their experience. In the current study we investigated whether people's meta-cognitive beliefs about controlling trauma-related intrusions influenced the occurrence and meta-awareness of those intrusions. People are not always aware of their trauma intrusions, and importantly, people with strong beliefs are more likely to notice trauma related intrusions both with and without meta-awareness than people with weak beliefs. We recruited participants who scored high (strong beliefs) or low (weak beliefs) on beliefs regarding the importance of controlling intrusive thoughts. Participants viewed a trauma film then-during a subsequent reading task-reported any film-related intrusions they noticed. We also intermittently asked half the participants to report what they were thinking at that particular moment, to ""catch"" intrusions without meta-awareness. We used an analogue trauma, and focused on a particular metacognitive belief, both of which somewhat limit generalizability. We also cannot definitively rule out demand effects. This study investigated the impact of providing corrective information about the nature of intrusive thoughts on their subsequent appraisal in a community sample.

This study investigated the impact of providing corrective information about the nature of intrusive thoughts on their subsequent appraisal in a community sample. Abnormalities in cognitive control and disgust responding are well-documented in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and also interfere with flexible, outcome-driven utilitarian moral reasoning. The current study examined whether individuals with OCD differ from healthy and anxious individuals in their use of utilitarian moral reasoning, and whether abnormalities in inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and disgust contribute to moral rigidity. Individuals with OCD (n = 23), non-OCD anxiety (n = 21) and healthy participants (n = 24) gave forced-choice responses to three types of moral dilemmas: benign, impersonal, personal. Scores on measures of cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control and trait disgust were also examined. Individuals with OCD gave fewer utilitarian responses to impersonal moral dilemmas compared to healthy, but not anxious, individuals. Poorer cognitive flexibility was associated with fewer utilitarian responses to impersonal dilemmas in the OCD group. Furthermore, greater trait disgust was associated with increased utilitarian responding to personal dilemmas in the OCD group, but decreased utilitarian responding to impersonal dilemmas in the anxious group. Harm avoidance (HA) and ""not just right experience"" (NJRE) have been proposed to be 2 core motivational processes underlying obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The objective of this study was to explore whether NJRE demarcates a neurodevelopmental OCD subgroup distinct from HA related to autistic traits and/or to a broader phenotype of cognitive rigidity and sensory processing difficulties associated with an earlier age of OCD onset. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been associated with impairments in stop-signal inhibition, a measure of motor response suppression. The study used a novel paradigm to examine both thought suppression and response inhibition in OCD, where the modulatory effects of stimuli relevant to OCD could also be assessed. Additionally, the study compared inhibitory impairments in OCD patients with and without co-morbid depression, as depression is the major co-morbidity of OCD.

Context: Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug; it is converted to its active metabolite through the cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) pathway, which also metabolizes calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Several studies have reported that CCBs reduce the ability of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet aggregability; one suggested that CCBs reduce the efficacy of clopidogrel.

Context: In this paper, we measure the effectiveness of Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) programmes in promoting the well-being of people with disabilities and removing the barriers to their participation in family and community decision-making processes. The Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) is a common approach to work with disable people to improve their quality of life by improving the level of productivity and integrating them into society. But the effectiveness of CBR varies by country to country. The aim of the study was to find out whether CBR programs really improved the level of productivity among persons with physical disabilities. CBR has a positive impact on the well-being of persons with disabilities participating in the programme and particularly on their participation within the family and the society at large. The main findings show that participation in the rehabilitation group was described as a special community of mutual understanding and belonging. Education and the sharing of knowledge provided a clearer vocabulary for, and understanding of, the women's own lived experiences. The presence of dedicated and professional care workers was reported to be essential for the outcome of the group intervention.

It has been hypothesized that general hyperarousal, present during both sleep and wakefulness, may underlie chronic insomnia. The present study explored, under strictly controlled conditions, whether chronic insomnia is associated with altered physiologic markers of arousal, both in absolute levels and in terms of circadian rhythmicity, relative to controls. Chronic primary insomnia has been hypothesized to result from conditioned arousal or the inability to initiate normal sleep processes. The event-related potentials (ERPs) N1, P2, and N350 are useful indexes of arousal. The objective is to compare these ERPs in primary chronic psychophysiological insomniacs (INS) and good sleepers (GS) during multiple recordings. Our recent ERPs study suggested inhibition deficits in addition to cortical arousal in insomnia sufferers (INS) relative to good sleepers (GS). The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation between objective sleep parameters and the amplitudes and latencies of ERPs components N1 and P2 in a multi-assessment protocol. The objective of this study was to identify if hyperarousal is a 24-hour phenomenon in insomnia by comparing sleep during napping between good sleepers (GS) and Insomnia sufferers (INS) (subdivided into paradoxical ""PARA-I"" and psychophysiological ""PSY-I"") following a mentally challenging battery of cognitive tests.

26,Plakoglobin: a diagnostic marker of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in forensic pathology?,"Q: Plakoglobin: a diagnostic marker of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in forensic pathology?
Context: The histopathological diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) can be challenging in forensic medicine. Immunohistochemical myocardial analysis for plakoglobin has been suggested as a new diagnostic test for ARVC. We examined this in the setting of forensic pathology, applying this method to forensic autopsy samples. We performed immunohistochemical staining for plakoglobin on 40 myocardial samples with an autopsy diagnosis of ARVC. In addition, histopathological reevaluation was performed applying the revised 2010 task force criteria including morphometric analysis. Myocardial samples from 15 subjects without heart disease were used as controls. The diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy can be challenging. Disease-causing mutations in desmosomal genes have been identified. A novel diagnostic feature, loss of immunoreactivity for plakoglobin from the intercalated disks, recently was proposed. Based on the histopathological reevaluation, 38 out of 40 cases were categorized as ARVC. A marked reduction in the plakoglobin staining was seen in 26 out of 38 myocardial samples in the ARVC-group. Of the two samples categorized as not ARVC, one showed reduced plakoglobin staining and one sample had normal staining. No control samples showed reduced plakoglobin staining. Plasma levels of some biomarkers and markers of collagen turnover may reflect myocardial structural abnormalities associated with diastolic dysfunction. The aim of this study was to determine whether these markers could contribute to the diagnostics of heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF).

The aim of this study was to determine whether these markers could contribute to the diagnostics of heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). Noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is considered to be the result of an arrest in the normal myocardial embryogenesis. The histological, developmental, and electrophysiological explanation of ventricular arrhythmias in NCCM is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the origin of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in NCCM and to identify any predominant arrhythmic foci. Retrospective data from our NCCM registry including 101 patients were analyzed. A total number of 2069 electrocardiograms (ECGs) were studied to determine the origin of PVCs. Echocardiographic data were analyzed in patients with PVCs in all 12 leads. Segments affected by noncompaction (NC) were compared with the origin of PVCs. Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is the result of incomplete myocardial morphogenesis, leading to persistence of the embryonic myocardium. The condition is recognized by an excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle. Whether these intertrabecular recesses are a favorable substrate for ventricular arrhythmias is unclear. Some reports have found that the fatal ventricular arrhythmias may occur in approximately half of the patients. In this report we investigated about this association. Five patients with nonischemic and five with ischemic cardiomyopathy due to anterior myocardial infarction were enrolled. No correlation was observed between values of repolarization among patients. The optimal values of repolarization were significantly different from values of echocardiographic parameters.

Context: In management of intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), controversy exists over the efficacy of re-resection for patients with preserved liver function. This study aimed to determine the long-term outcomes of re-resection in these patients. The safety and effectiveness of hepatic resection for recurrent or refractory hepatocellular is not established, particularly in cases treated by non-surgical treatment. In compensated cirrhotics with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC-cirr), upfront liver resection (LR) and salvage liver transplantation (SLT) in case of recurrence may have outcomes comparable to primary LT (PLT). This study evaluated long-term outcomes of salvage surgery as additional therapy following downstaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with initially unresectable HCC. The role of liver resection in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (multinodular or with macroscopic vascular involvement) is still controversial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of surgical resection compared to other therapeutic modalities in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of surgical resection compared to other therapeutic modalities in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). High operative mortality has been reported after liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients with high preoperative serum alanine aminotransferase (sALT) level. Their long-term prognosis has never been investigated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the benefit of liver resection for HCC in this subgroup of patients. Liver resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Child-Pugh class C cirrhotic patients is considered to be high risk and even contraindicated. This study examined our results of hepatectomy for HCC in such cirrhotic patients. Resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis and impaired liver function is usually unjustified because of higher surgical risks and poorer long-term prognosis. Liver transplantation (LT) is the optimal therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the setting of cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results after LT for HCC patients with very low alpha fetoprotein (AFP) values both in our series and in literature reports. Hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients generally carries a poor prognosis either due to recurrence or to postoperative morbidity or both. Several factors affect the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma resection as presence of cirrhosis of the liver, tumor diameter and tumor capsulation.

29,What inhibits S-palmitoylation?,"Q: What inhibits S-palmitoylation?
Context: The tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA) inhibit the liver mitochondrial low Km aldehyde dehydrogenase and possess alcohol-aversive and immunosuppressant properties. As the disulfiram (DS) metabolite carbon disulphide activates enzymes forming 3-HK and 3-HAA, we investigated if repeated disulfiram treatment increases the hepatic and serum levels of these 2 metabolites. DS increased liver and serum [3-HK] and [3-HAA]possibly by increasing the flux of tryptophan down the hepatic kynurenine pathway and activation of kynurenine hydroxylase and kynureninase. Livers and sera of male Wistar rats were analysed for tryptophan and kynurenine metabolites after repeated DS treatment for 7 days.

To test whether the combined application of dexamethasone (DEXA) and 3,5-dimethyl-3'-isopropyl-L-thyronine (DIMIT) induces the synthesis of surfactant protein A (SP-A) mRNA at a higher rate than both substances given alone? We sought to determine whether the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is similar with 12- vs 24-hour dosing interval of betamethasone. The study aims to reconcile conflicting published reports regarding the clinical efficacy of a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity. There was an increased incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the study group (97% versus 45%; P<0.001), an increased need for surfactant use (68% versus 26%; P<0.001) and increased ventilatory support, and an increased incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (47% versus 24%; P=0.03). Gestation could not be prolonged significantly by the addition of indomethacin. Incidence of RDS was similar in the 2 cohorts (36.5% vs 37.3%; P = not significant).

Context: Obesity constitutes a clear risk factor for cholelithiasis, especially if it is associated with a rapid weight loss, as is the case of patients following bariatric surgery. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is indicated in biliopancreatic diversions due to the high incidence of postoperative cholelithiasis. However, there is no agreement on gastric bypass. This study was conducted to establish the incidence of cholecystopathy demonstrated by histology and to assess the indication for prophylactic cholecystectomy in a systematic way on patients undergoing gastric bypass. The preoperative investigation for choledocholithiasis in patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy is still a matter of debate.

Developmentally sensitive methods of assessing CU traits have recently been generated, but their construct validity in relation to neurocognitive underpinnings of CU has not been demonstrated. The current study sought to investigate whether the fear-specific emotion recognition deficits associated with CU traits in older individuals are developmentally expressed in young children as low concern for others and punishment insensitivity. Children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits, a proposed precursor to adult psychopathy, are characterized by impaired emotion recognition, reduced responsiveness to others' distress, and a lack of guilt or empathy. Reduced attention to faces, and more specifically to the eye region, has been proposed to underlie these difficulties, although this has never been tested longitudinally from infancy. Attention to faces occurs within the context of dyadic caregiver interactions, and early environment including parenting characteristics has been associated with CU traits. The present study tested whether infants' preferential tracking of a face with direct gaze and levels of maternal sensitivity predict later CU traits. Using data from 5,923 mother-child pairs participating in The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, the authors tested the outcomes of internalizing difficulties and callous-unemotional traits (based on mother report at age 13) via the predictors (at ages 8 and 10) of irritability (mother report) and the experience of peer victimization (youth report). Oppositional defiant disorder children, assessed for callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and controls, were observed in a brief interaction task where the mother was asked to show love to her child. Eye contact and affection were measured for each dyad. A subsample of 337 preschoolers (mean age 4.8 years, SD = 0.8) who completed neurocognitive tasks was taken from a larger project of preschool psychopathology. Children completed an emotional recognition task in which they were asked to identify the emotional face from the neutral faces in an array. CU traits were assessed using the Low Concern (LC) and Punishment Insensitivity (PI) subscales of the Multidimensional Assessment Profile of Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB), which were specifically designed to differentiate the normative misbehavior of early childhood from atypical patterns.

Context: To investigate the relationship between urinary excretion of fetal zone steroids (3beta-OH-5-ene-steroids) and the severity of lung disease in preterm infants with respect to gender. To test whether glucocorticoids act as the endogenous agonist of cardiac mineralocorticoid receptors, we evaluated the cardiac effects of aldosterone and corticosterone and cardiac steroidogenesis vs. steroid uptake from plasma. To evaluate if the renotrophic factor can pass through the placenta and act on the fetal kidney. The purpose of this study was to determine whether corticosteroid administration after 34 weeks of gestation is associated with improved neonatal outcome in the presence of fetal lung immaturity. To evaluate whether maternal blood cortisol acts as an entrainer of the fetus, we compared diurnal variations in the fetal heart rate (FHR) of two cases with Cushing's syndrome, under condition of glucocorticoid replacement therapy after adrenalectomy.

Context: The aim of the present study was to assess accommodation as a possible indicator of changes in the autonomic balance caused by altered cognitive demand. Accounting for accommodative responses from a human factors perspective may be motivated by the interest of designing virtual image displays or by establishing an autonomic indicator that allows for remote measurement at the human eye. Heart period, pulse transit time, and the pupillary response were considered as reference for possible closed-loop accommodative effects. Cognitive demand was varied by presenting monocularly numbers at a viewing distance of 5 D (20 cm) which had to be read, added or multiplied; further, letters were presented in a ""n-back"" task. Cardiovascular parameters and pupil size indicated a change in autonomic balance, while error rates and reaction time confirmed the increased cognitive demand during task processing. An observed decrease in accommodation could not be attributed to the cognitive demand itself for two reasons: (1) the cognitive demand induced a shift in gaze direction which, for methodological reasons, accounted for a substantial part of the observed accommodative changes. (2) Remaining effects disappeared when the correctness of task processing was taken into account. Clinical accommodation testing involves measuring either accommodative optical changes or accommodative biometric changes. Quantifying both optical and biometric changes during accommodation might be helpful in the design and evaluation of accommodation restoration concepts. This study aims to establish the accuracy of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in predicting the accommodative optical response (AOR) from biometric changes. All parameters were measured on two separate occasions in 30 myopic habitual contact lens and spectacle wearers of mean age 19 ± 2.4 years. Some parameters such as accommodation amplitude, accommodative response, and stimulus AC:A ratio were measured using two measurement methods which are commonly used in clinical practice. Three measurements were taken for each parameter and averaged. For the comparative statistical analysis, we used the Student's t-test (p value < 0.05). Ninety-two eyes of all subjects underwent complete ocular examination, including intraocular pressure measurement by Goldmann applanation tonometer, objective refraction, and slit-lamp biomicroscopy. Topographic measurements and corneal pachymetry were performed using a Scheimpflug-based (Pentacam, Oculus, Germany) corneal topographer. Corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) were measured with an Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA, Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, Buffalo, NY).

Context: There are 44 million missing women in India. Gender bias; neglect of girls, infanticides and feticides are responsible. The sex ratio at birth can be used to examine the influence of antenatal sex selection on the sex ratio. India is the only nation where girls have greater risks of under-5 mortality than boys. We test whether female disadvantage in breastfeeding and food allocation accounts for gender disparities in mortality. Preference for sons in India has resulted in a skewed sex ratio at live birth, probably as a consequence of female feticide. However, it is unclear if these cultural preferences are also currently present in communities who have emigrated from India to England and Wales. While India has made significant progress in reducing maternal mortality, attaining further declines will require increased skilled birth attendance and institutional delivery among marginalized and difficult to reach populations.

Stillbirth rates. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There is also an association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive ability. Since low birth weight is associated with adult metabolic disease, particularly in obese subjects, the question emerges whether obesity has an additional negative effect on cognitive function in subjects with low birth weight. The aim was to analyse whether overweight or obesity influence intellectual performance in young adults with particular focus on those with a low birth weight. The risk for low intellectual performance was higher for those with high BMI compared to those with normal. The highest risk was found among subjects with low birth weight and overweight or obesity in young adulthood (odds ratios, 1.98 [1.73-2.22] and 2.59 [2.00-3.34], respectively). However, subjects with further high birth weight and a high BMI at conscription had no further increased risk. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether adolescent pregnancy is a risk factor for low birth weight (LBW) babies. Individuals born at low or high birth weight (BW) have elevated adiposity. The extent to which physical activity can mitigate this risk is unknown. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Previously, we have shown that if the study mother is a non-smoker, there is increased mean birth weight, length and body mass index (BMI) in her sons if she herself had been exposed prenatally to her mother's smoking. The aim of this study was to determine whether the prenatal smoke exposure of either parent influenced the growth of the fetus of a smoking woman, and whether any effects were dependent on the fetal sex. Animal data suggest that tobacco smoke exposure of a mother when she is in utero influences DNA methylation patterns in her offspring and that there is an effect on the respiratory system, particularly airway responsiveness. The only study, to our knowledge, in humans suggests that there is a similar effect on asthma.

Context: The high prevalence of allergic rhinitis that occurs in elite athletes has been extensively investigated. However, data among recreational athletes practicing indoor activities remain contradictory. The aim of the present study was to determine whether taking part in gym based sporting activities constitutes a risk factor for allergic rhinitis in recreational athletes. A group of 50 recreational athletes was examined. A specific questionnaire for the screening of allergic rhinitis and a battery of skin prick-tests to aeroallergens were administered to each participant. Measurements of nasal symptoms, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) and lung function were also obtained before and after a training session. Thirty-two percent of the participants were atopic, 18% suffered from allergic rhinitis. This prevalence is similar to that of the general population (16.9%). After exercise, nasal symptom prevalence did not change significantly. However, an improvement in nasal inspiratory flow was observed in 70% of the participants. No statistically significant change in lung function was noticed. Allergic rhinitis (AR) has become the most prevalent chronic allergic disorder in childhood, and the role of environment has been questioned, particularly in early life. While a number of studies suggest that air pollution is associated with allergic rhinitis in children, findings among adults have been equivocal.

Context: There are no factors in the literature to predict a poor prognosis except for reconstruction of the flexor pollicis longus.

The results in the literature of superficialis finger reconstruction are significantly better (P<0.001). Two-stage surgical reconstruction of the flexor tendons by the Hunter technique is the salvage option in case of old tears or a severely damaged fibro-osseous canal. Do implant survival and function decrease with time and do high-flexion activities increase the risk of premature failure? We asked the following questions: (1) What is the reinfection rate after two-stage exchange arthroplasty? (2) Which risk factors predict failure? (3) Which variables are associated with acquiring a resistant organism periprosthetic joint infection? Both groups were comparable for age and sex. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, calf circumference, or the MFAI scores measured at 2, 8, 12, 26, or 52 weeks.

Context: The objective of this study is to determine what percentage of fetal chromosomal anomalies remains undetected when first trimester combined testing is replaced by non-invasive prenatal testing for trisomies 13, 18, and 21. We focused on the added clinical value of nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. To investigate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) in fetuses with a crown-rump length (CRL) below 45 mm needs to be re-evaluated at a later stage, or whether the early NT measurement can be used effectively as an aneuploidy marker. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there is a nuchal translucency (NT) measurement, independent of gestational age, above which immediate diagnostic testing should be offered without waiting for first trimester serum markers. To examine the possible association between high fetal nuchal translucency thickness (NT) and pathogenic chromosomal copy number variants (CNVs) detected by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in pregnancies with normal fetal karyotype.

The causes of oral clefts (cleft lip with or without cleft palate, CL/P, and cleft palate alone, CP) have not been established. However, maternal intrauterine hormone profiles have been suspected of being involved. There is now substantial evidence that maternal hormone concentrations around the time of conception partially control the sexes of offspring. It is possible that the hormone profiles that control sex of offspring share features of the profiles suspected of causing clefts. This can be tested by examining the sex ratios (proportions male) of the unaffected sibs of probands.

As well as these side effects, corticosteroids have strong immunosuppressive effects, raising concerns regarding their use in acute infections, despite their potential effect in controlling excessive inflammatory response. The immunosuppressant effect of corticosteroids is related to dose and treatment duration. For example, the use of 40 mg of prednisolone per day for more than 1 week or 20 mg prednisolone or equivalent per day for a month can produce immunosuppression. In acute infection, a low dose for a short period', 'Title: New aspects in the management of pneumonia\nPassage: Glucocorticosteroid drugs reproduce effects similar to endogenous cortisol: they have anti-inflammatory activity by switching genes on and off, resulting in a reduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Such success is, however, only likely to outweigh potential complications in the setting of vigilant surveillance for nosocomial infection and eschewal of neuromuscular blockade due to the potential complications of steroid treatment. Furthermore, it has been suggested that if left to later time points, i.e. >14 days postonset, steroid administration may cause a paradoxical increase', 'Title: New aspects in the management of pneumonia\nPassage: may be useful for reducing inflammation and may not cause so much harm by producing immunosuppression.

On the other hand, age and sex had a significant influence on the pharmacokinetic pattern of trazodone, causing higher concentrations in females and in older patients. Since the polypharmacy investigated did not change the serum levels of trazodone, we assume that there is no metabolic interaction between trazodone and citalopram and trazodone and fluoxetine. We observed none of the adverse effects which might have been expected, including dizziness, severe headache, daytime sedation, fatigue or the serotonin syndrome even in a mild form.', 'The aim of this prospective study was to investigate serum levels of trazodone when prescribed as monotherapy or when used in combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and fluoxetine in a simultaneous assay using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Fifty-two patients were smokers, the mean age was 39.9 years and the mean weight was 72.4 kg; 40 patients were taking trazodone alone, 41 trazodone in combination with citalopram and 16 patients trazodone in combination with fluoxetine.', 'Trazodone is well-absorbed by the mouth and is metabolized by three cytochromes: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Clinical benefits include reduced insomnia in those depressed and/or on antidepressants. Pain may be relieved by mechanisms similar to venlafaxine. Delirium unresponsive to neuroleptics has been reported to respond to trazodone. Drug interactions are a risk due to cytochrome metabolism.', 'Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of the new generation antidepressants is subject of controversial discussion. Nonetheless, TDM may safeguard against drug-drug interactions, can be used to control compliance and is valuable in the investigation of overdose.', 'Unpublished studies did not substantially alter the risk-to-benefit determination. Cumulative meta-analyses of seven randomized, controlled trials for efficacy and 11 randomized, controlled trials for safety suggest an adverse safety/efficacy profile for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) overall. Fluoxetine and citalopram appear to offer favorable risk to benefit profiles, while shorter-acting agents pose greater risks and provide marginal benefit.']"

Context: Accumulating evidence suggests that the donor's cause of death may influence posttransplantation allograft function. We conducted a retrospective analysis of our adult lung transplant experience to investigate the influence of donor traumatic brain injury versus nontraumatic brain injury on posttransplantation outcome. Few data support current guidelines for donor selection in lung transplantation. We determined degree of compliance with current donor guidelines, effect of these and variances on survival, and other donor factors predicting survival. We compared 1) survival after lung transplantation of recipients of donation after cardiac death (DCD) versus brain death donor organs in the United States and 2) recipient characteristics. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of donor cause of brain death on the results of kidney transplantation. Lung transplantation is currently limited by a donor shortage and the need for a short organ ischemic time.

We examined the relationship between pain and (1) interference with daily functioning (DFi) and (2) outcomes in an obese treatment-seeking population. This study was a retrospective analysis of information abstracted from medical records of 673 adult patients utilizing family medicine. Pain was measured using a scale ranging from 0 to 10. Scores of 7 and above were judged to represent high levels of pain. Multiple logistic regression was used to test the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and general pain, after adjustment for co-morbidity, physical limitations, and demographic characteristics. Internal medicine residents and attending physicians at three academic urban primary care clinics and their adult patients participated in a study using recognition and documentation of patient obesity as the main measures. The objective of this study was to assess the association of obesity with the utilization of general practitioners (GP), medical specialists (MS), physical therapists (PT), and alternative practitioners (AP), and to elucidate whether body weight dissatisfaction mediates extant associations. Obesity is considered a growing health threat in the United States.

There are few data regarding how physician body weight might affect patient receptiveness to obesity counseling. Overweight and obesity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There is also an association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive ability. Since low birth weight is associated with adult metabolic disease, particularly in obese subjects, the question emerges whether obesity has an additional negative effect on cognitive function in subjects with low birth weight. The aim was to analyse whether overweight or obesity influence intellectual performance in young adults with particular focus on those with a low birth weight. The risk for low intellectual performance was higher for those with high BMI compared to those with normal. The highest risk was found among subjects with low birth weight and overweight or obesity in young adulthood (odds ratios, 1.98 [1.73-2.22] and 2.59 [2.00-3.34], respectively). However, subjects with further high birth weight and a high BMI at conscription had no further increased risk.

45,Is there an association between skeletal asymmetry and tooth absence?,"Q: Is there an association between skeletal asymmetry and tooth absence?
Context: Previous studies have suggested that family members with intracranial aneurysms (IAs) often harbor IAs in similar anatomic locations. IA location is important because of its association with rupture. We tested the hypothesis that anatomic susceptibility to IA location exists using a family-based IA study. The purpose of this study was to establish whether individuals with a family history of>/=2 first-degree relatives with intracranial aneurysm should be offered screening for aneurysm. Research into the etiopathogenesis of intracranial aneurysms has failed to demonstrate molecular markers or pathognomonic genetic sequences. The authors describe the case of aneurysmal rupture in a patient with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome and explore a possible molecular link. The aim of our study was to investigate plasma and genetic risk factors for rupture of cerebral aneurysms. A risk factor assessment that reliably predicts whether patients are predisposed to intracranial aneurysm (IA) rupture has yet to be formulated. As such, the clinical management of unruptured IA remains unclear. Our aim was to determine whether impaired arterial distensibility and hypertrophic remodeling might be indicators of risk for IA rupture.MATERIAL/ Previous studies have suggested that family members with intracranial aneurysms (IAs) often harbor IAs in similar anatomic locations.

Context: The difficulty many birth defects registries have in identifying early pregnancy terminations can lead to significant underreporting of certain types of malformations. This study was designed to determine the potential benefit of using maternal ICD-9 codes relating to management of pregnancy due to fetal anomaly in surveillance of central nervous system (CNS) defects (655.0). Women assigned the ICD-9/ICD-9-CM (henceforth termed ICD-9) code 655.0 between 1990 and 2000 were ascertained from two administrative health databases in Manitoba, Canada, one relating to maternal serum screening and one based on hospital discharges. Information was collected on the type of CNS defect identified and whether it was isolated or associated with other anomalies. The relationship of these variables to pregnancy outcome and its potential impact on surveillance for these types of defects was explored. Neural tube defects were the most common finding (67%) identified in the fetuses/infants of women assigned code 655.0, followed by hydrocephaly (20%) and Dandy-Walker anomaly (6%), but the proportion of neural tube defect cases declined after food fortification with folic acid. Termination of pregnancy occurred in ∼50% of neural tube defect cases, 18% before 20 weeks of gestation, but was rare for other CNS defects. Perinatal deaths from congenital cardiovascular, central nervous system or chromosomal abnormality in 2010 were identified retrospectively. Data were extracted by retrospective clinical note review and obtained by independent review of ultrasound scans. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes were used to identify prenatal, obstetric, postpartum maternal complications, and newborn health conditions. We used multivariable logistic regression to describe the associations between maternal and infant health conditions and the odds for postpartum hospitalisation for psychosis.

47,Cervical cancer screening of HIV-positive women: is a prolongation of the screening interval meaningful?,"Q: Cervical cancer screening of HIV-positive women: is a prolongation of the screening interval meaningful?
Context: Increased mammographic breast density is well recognized as a breast cancer risk factor in the general population. However, it is unclear whether it is a risk factor in women with BRCA mutations. We present the results of a nested case-control screening study investigating the relationship between breast density and breast cancer incidence in this population. Women ages 25 to 65 years with known BRCA mutations were enrolled onto a single-center, high-risk breast cancer screening program. Using a computer-aided technique (Cumulus), quantitative percentage density (PD) was measured for each participant on her baseline mammogram by a single, blinded observer. Several observational studies have shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is significantly more sensitive than mammography for screening women over age 25 at high risk for hereditary breast cancer; however, MRI is more costly and less specific than mammography. We sought to determine the extent to which the low sensitivity of mammography is due to greater breast density. The utility of screening mammography for older women with low bone mineral density (BMD) is controversial. This case-control study compares BMD at multiple sites in women with and without breast cancer to determine if BMD prescreening is useful in selecting women for continued screening mammograms. Mammography screening is a promising method for improving prognosis in breast cancer.

The objective of this study is to determine what percentage of fetal chromosomal anomalies remains undetected when first trimester combined testing is replaced by non-invasive prenatal testing for trisomies 13, 18, and 21. We focused on the added clinical value of nuchal translucency (NT) measurement. To investigate whether increased nuchal translucency (NT) in fetuses with a crown-rump length (CRL) below 45 mm needs to be re-evaluated at a later stage, or whether the early NT measurement can be used effectively as an aneuploidy marker. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether there is a nuchal translucency (NT) measurement, independent of gestational age, above which immediate diagnostic testing should be offered without waiting for first trimester serum markers.

Context: It has been suggested that hospital admission during weekends poses a risk for adverse outcomes and increased patient mortality, the so-called 'weekend effect'. We undertook an evaluation of the impact of weekend admissions to the management of polytraumatised patients, in a Level I Major Trauma Centre (MTC) in the UK. Many previous studies have shown that patients admitted to hospital at weekends have worse outcomes than those on other days. It has been proposed that parity of clinical services throughout the week could mitigate the 'weekend effect'.

Context: Perceptions of competence mediate the relationship between motor skill proficiency and physical activity among older children and adolescents. This study examined kindergarten children's perceptions of physical competence as a mediator of the relationship between motor skill proficiency as a predictor variable and physical activity levels as the outcome variable; and also with physical activity as a predictor and motor skill proficiency as the outcome. Participants were 116 children (mean age = 5 years 7 months, 58% boys) from 10 schools. Motor skills were measured using the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 and physical activity was monitored through accelerometry. Perceptions of physical competence were measured using The Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young Children, and the relationships between these variables were examined using a model of mediation. Movement skill competence (e.g. the ability to throw, run and kick) is a potentially important physical activity determinant. However, little is known about the long-term impact of interventions to improve movement skills in early childhood. This study aimed to determine whether intervention preschool children were still more skill proficient than controls three years after a 10 month movement skill focused intervention: 'Tooty Fruity Vegie in Preschools'.

Previous research has shown a positive relationship between activity-related social support provided by parents and peers and adolescents' physical activity. However, more information is needed on whether activity-related social support differs by sociodemographic characteristics. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in activity-related social support in a sample of adolescents, by characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, and physical activity level and to determine which characteristics are the most important predictors of activity-related social support. Boys, White British, younger, more physically active, and high-SES adolescents perceived more support for physical activity. Age predicted all types of support excluding peer support; ethnicity predicted mother logistic support and sibling support; gender predicted peer support, father explicit modeling, and father logistic support; and SES predicted mother and father logistic support. Using the social cognitive theory, this study aims to examine how gender moderates the direct and indirect relationships of various sources of social support on Chinese adolescents' physical activity (PA). Social (2.53; 0.38) and active-physical activities were most preferred (2.10; 0.42), and self-improvement activities were least preferred (1.93; 0.49).

Context: Tumor angiogenesis is believed to be a prognostic indicator associated with tumor growth and metastasis. Studies of angiogenesis in breast, prostate, and lung cancer, as well as melanoma, have shown that neovascularization correlates with the likelihood of metastasis and recurrences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate microvessel density as a prognostic factor in endometrial cancer. The expression of serum angiogenic factors has been associated with tumor dissemination and poor prognosis in multiple cancer types. However, it is still unclear whether these angiogenic molecules can be used as an independent molecular marker or in correlation with other parameters for predicting the prognosis of colorectal carcinoma (CRC)patients. 147 patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 1995 and 2001 were included in the study. Patients' demographics, clinical and pathological data were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for p53, VEGF, Ki-67 and HIF-1alpha was performed on tissue micro array sections. Tumors' expression of p53, VEGF, Ki-67, and HIF-1alpha was compared based on ethnicity and tumor type (Type I = endometrioid carcinomas and Type II = non-endometrioid carcinomas). Spearman's correlation and Fisher's Exact Tests were used for statistical analysis and Kaplan-Meier, log-rank and Cox regression were used for survival analysis. To investigate the role of angiogenesis in predicting tumor recurrence and its correlation with established clinicopathologic prognostic factors in superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Angiogenesis has a vital role in tumor growth and metastasis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) represents a potent cytokine in this process. However, the influence of VEGF in ovarian cancer remains controversial. Interest has focused on the use of antiangiogenic drugs in ovarian cancer. This study aims to establish the pattern of expression and effect on prognosis of VEGF in a large population of ovarian cancer patients and to potentially identify a cohort in whom antiangiogenic therapy is appropriate.

Functional outcomes after knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain poor. The ability to restore the soft tissue envelope intraoperatively may improve such outcomes. The aim of this study was to extend the scope of computer navigation as a tool to quantifying the envelope of laxity during subjective stress testing preoperatively and to quantify the effects of knee replacement and how it changes as a result of ligamentous failure. Loaded cadaveric legs were mounted on a purpose-built rig. Envelope of laxity was measured in 3 degrees of freedom using computer navigation. Knees were subjectively stressed in varus/valgus, internal/external rotation and anterior draw. This was performed preoperatively, during TKA and after sequential sectioning of ligaments. Real-time data were recorded at 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° of flexion. Mixed effect modelling was used to quantify the effects of intervention on degree of laxity. Rotatory knee laxity was retrospectively analysed in 42 patients, including two different ACL reconstructions. The maximal anterior displacement and the absolute value of the posterior acceleration reached during the reduction of the tibial lateral compartment were intra-operatively acquired by using a navigation system and identified as discriminating parameters. For each parameter, statistical linear regression analysis (line slope and intercept) was performed between pre- and post-reconstruction values. To evaluate the influence of the medial-lateral stability of the joint on the short-term clinical outcomes after performing navigation in total knee replacement. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether varus-valgus laxities under static stress in extension, femoral condylar lift-off during walking, and patient-reported outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were related to the stability of the knee joint.

The absence of a logical targeted pattern in the new viral sequences and a close relative in a wildlife species are the most revealing signs that SARS-CoV-2 evolved by natural evolution. A search for an intermediate animal host between bats and humans is needed to identify animal CoVs more closely related to human SARS-CoV-2. There is speculation that pangolins might carry CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, but the data to substantiate this is not yet published .', 'Title: No credible evidence supporting claims of the laboratory engineering of SARS-CoV-2\nPassage: Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13. In our view, there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host.

55,Identification of isochromosome 1q as a recurring chromosome aberration in skull base chordomas: a new marker for aggressive tumors?,"Q: Identification of isochromosome 1q as a recurring chromosome aberration in skull base chordomas: a new marker for aggressive tumors?
Context: A series of 22 skull base chordomas was analyzed with G banding. Subsequently, metaphase cells obtained from three tumors were reexamined using multicolor spectral karyotyping. Clonal chromosome aberrations were identified in 11 cases, all of which were recurrent tumors. Three tumors showed a remarkable similarity in cytogenetic features, and these features appear to characterize a recurring combination of nonrandom chromosome aberrations, including isochromosome 1q, gain of chromosome 7, and monosomy for chromosomes 3, 4, 10,13, and 18. Isochromosome 1q was identified as the sole recurring structural chromosome rearrangement in these tumors. The pattern of chromosome loss reported in the progression of lumbosacral chordoma also appears to be true of skull base chordomas with the additional findings of isochromosome 1q, gain of chromosome 7, and loss of chromosome 18. The authors conducted a study of 22 skull base chordomas. Clonal chromosome aberrations were detected in 18 patients, 17 of whom had the characteristic t(11;22)(q24;q12) or variants thereof. The most frequent secondary change was +8, followed by +12, +2, +5, +9, +15, and gain of material from the long and short arms of chromosome 1. The only recurrent secondary change that was restricted to tumors from the ten patients that were dead at latest follow-up was gain of 1q material. Furthermore, all three patients with tumors with chromosome numbers over 50 had died, and the only patient with a tumor karyotype lacking chromosome 22 rearrangement was alive without evidence of disease. The detection of recurring genetic changes in breast cancer can be extremely difficult. The tumors display very complex structural chromosomal rearrangements the origin of which are often very difficult to establish. The identification of recurrent chromosomal changes is a useful strategy for understanding tumorigenesis and specific chromosomal associations. Isochromosome i(5p) is a frequent finding in several types of cancer but it has been rarely described in breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of i(5p) in primary breast tumors.

Context: To compare the surgical outcomes of combined corneal-incision cataract surgery and viscocanalostomy (phaco-VCS) with or without the adjunctive peeling of juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) in 136 patients of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In a prospective clinical trial, 63 eyes underwent phaco-VCS (Peeling (-) group), and 73 eyes underwent phaco-VCS with the peeling of JCT (Peeling (+) group). The postoperative IOP, the probability of successful IOP reduction without medications, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. The study goal was to determine whether creating a subperiosteal tunnel before lateral osteotomy had an effect on postoperative periorbital edema, ecchymosis, and subconjunctival ecchymosis. This study compares the frequencies of traumatic wound dehiscence following extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and following phacoemulsification through a self-sealing corneoscleral tunnel. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of reduced postoperative follow-up after phacoemulsification using a scleral tunnel technique.

Borderline epithelial ovarian tumors have good prognosis without any adjuvant therapy. The advantage of aggressive surgical staging, especially retroperitoneal lymph node sampling is questionable in patients with borderline ovarian tumors. We designed this study to evaluate the necessity of retroperitoneal pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection in the treatment of borderline epithelial ovarian tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether systematic lymphadenectomy is necessary in suboptimally cytoreduced patients with stage III ovarian carcinoma. The present study aims to compare the clinical and reproductive outcomes of women who have undergone lymph node dissection with those who have not and to discuss the indications for retroperitoneal evaluation in the treatment of borderline ovarian tumors. Controversy continues over the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy for the surgical treatment of Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. From 1998 to 2007, 57 women who were diagnosed with borderline epithelial ovarian tumor in our hospital were prospectively accrued and evaluated; 27 of them (47.3%) had full surgical staging procedure including para-aortic and pelvic node dissection.

Context: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori after peptic ulcer haemorrhage reduces the risk of recurrence. Because H. pylori treatment is very effective, it is unclear whether testing to confirm eradication is worthwhile. Among patients with peptic ulcer disease, the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori has been reported to range from 80% to 90%. Thus empirical cost-effective therapy has been suggested. We surveyed patients with peptic ulcer disease in Rochester, NY. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection prevents duodenal ulcer (DU) relapse, but it remains uncertain whether eradication of H. pylori alone heals duodenal ulceration.AIM: To test the hypothesis that eradication of H. pylori infection is accompanied by healing of duodenal ulcer. To examine whether patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer haemorrhage should be tested for successful eradication after completion of antibiotic therapy. To assess the prevalence of active Helicobacter pylori infection in patients admitted to the intensive care unit, to determine the effect of selective gut decontamination on the persistence of this organism, and to explore the possible relationship between H. pylori infection and stress ulcer bleeding incidence.

Vancomycin is used widely as empiric therapy for gram-positive organisms in patients with an intra-abdominal infection (IAI), even in those with no history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection or colonization. Potential adverse effects of vancomycin include nephrotoxicity, increased cost, and bacterial resistance. We hypothesized that MRSA nasal screening could be used to predict patients with a MRSA IAI and used to avoid unnecessary empiric vancomycin use. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are becoming an increasing problem, but the link with symptomatic sino-nasal infection has not previously been quantified. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients undergoing sino-nasal surgery. To test the hypothesis that methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) carriage may protect against nosocomial methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) acquisition by competing for colonization of the anterior nares. To determine the cost-effectiveness of a policy of screening high-risk patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization on admission to hospital. After the implementation of an active surveillance programme for MRSA in US Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers, there was an increase in vancomycin use. We investigated whether positive MRSA admission surveillance tests were associated with MRSA-positive clinical admission cultures and whether the availability of surveillance tests influenced prescribers' ability to match initial anti-MRSA antibiotic use with anticipated MRSA results from clinical admission cultures.

Context: Ureteroneocystostomy surgical techniques have been repeatedly debated in the medical literature, in contrast to pyeloureterostomy, which is merely considered a salvage procedure. We assessed urological complications and their management after routine pyeloureterostomy in adult kidney transplantation cases. To determine if routine follow-up diuresis renography is indicated in all adult patients after pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO). We assessed whether renography should be performed routinely following pyeloplasty.

Anastomotic stricture or stenosis is a well-described complication of intestinal anastomosis. The incidence of stricture after colorectal anastomosis ranges from 0 to 30 %. The aim of this study was to identify possible factors related to postoperative colorectal anastomotic stricture and to indicate reoperative surgery outcomes. Different studies have shown that low colorectal and coloanal anastomosis often yield poor functional results. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a colonic reservoir is able to improve functional results. The necessity of preoperative or intraoperative mechanical bowel preparation of the colon, before primary anastomosis, has been recently challenged in clinical elective and emergency situations. After institutional review board approval, medical records were reviewed for patients who underwent surgery for colorectal anastomotic stricture at Cleveland Clinic Florida between January 2001 and December 2010. The main outcome measures were demographics, indications for initial surgery, body mass index, comorbidities, previous treatment, level of anastomosis, history of radiotherapy, and operative data for the reoperative surgery. Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation is aimed to reduce the risk of infectious complications, and its utility is a dogma in left-sided large bowel anastomosis. The aim of this study was to specifically assess whether colocolonic and colorectal anastomoses may be safely performed without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation. Practice guidelines from international societies have recommended cholecystectomy during the same hospitalization for acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP). The aim of this study is to investigate the question of whether endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and/or cholecystectomy during the same hospitalization can reduce the recurrence rate of ABP. As many as 24% of patients who undergo endoscopic sphincterotomy for the removal of bile duct stones have recurrent biliary complications develop for which there is no effective method of prevention. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients who undergo routine clinical follow-up after endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones have a different outcome than those who do not. Patients with choledochocystolithiasis generally undergo endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) followed by elective cholecystectomy. They can experience the development of recurrent biliary events while waiting for their scheduled surgery.AIM: This study investigated whether stent insertion before cholecystectomy influences the rate of complications. The intact gallbladder after endoscopic sphincterotomy is thought to be a potential risk factor for recurrent biliary complications. The aim of this non-randomized prospective study was to investigate whether cholecystectomy soon after endoscopic sphincterotomy could prevent the recurrence of biliary complications. Using a 5% national Medicare sample (1996-2005), we evaluated adherence to current recommendations for gallstone pancreatitis (cholecystectomy rates on initial hospitalization and the use of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]/sphincterotomy).

Context: In clinical practice Body Mass Index is generally used to evaluate overweight status in adults. The present multicenter study examines whether Body Mass Index (BMI), age- and gender-adjusted Body Mass Index Standard Deviation Score, or calculated %body fat is a better predictor for cardiovascular disease risk factors, specifically hypertension and dyslipidemia, in a high-risk population. To examine whether an accurate measure (using a criterion standard method) of total body fat would be a better predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality than body mass index (BMI). In clinical practice, individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are identified on the basis of age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, and serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We examined whether CVD risk prediction improved when obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m(2)) and premature (<70 years) parental myocardial infarction (MI) were added to the classical risk factor model. Methods available to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk include the Joint British Societies Risk Chart (JBSRC), the CardioRisk Manager (CRM) calculator, the PROCAM calculation and specific to diabetes, the UKPDS risk engine. Our aim was to examine their efficacy in a clinic-based population of diabetic patients.

We have previously shown that induced abortions result in a slightly increased risk of spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies. Danish records show that approximately 4% of women who undergo surgically induced abortions have complications related to the procedure.

We wanted to assess the prevalence of ART in multiple birth infants seen for ROP screening and whether or not ROP was identified or treated, in order to evaluate whether ART contributes a risk factor for ROP independent of the generation of multiple births. It is well established that singletons born of assisted reproductive technology are at higher risk of preterm birth and other adverse outcomes. What remains unclear is whether the increased risk is attributable to the effects of the treatment alone or whether the underlying causes of infertility also play a role. The aim of this study was to examine whether any of the six categories of causes of infertility were associated with a direct effect on preterm birth using causal mediation analysis. Our purpose was to determine the risk of premature delivery among singleton pregnancies derived from assisted reproduction technology (ART). Maternal age is an important factor in reproduction. Can assisted reproduction technologies (ART) fully compensate for the decline in fertility with age? To determine if vaginal deliveries exposed to assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are associated with an increased time between delivery of the neonate and placenta and select complications.

The aim of this study was to examine whether any of the six categories of causes of infertility were associated with a direct effect on preterm birth using causal mediation analysis. Our purpose was to determine the risk of premature delivery among singleton pregnancies derived from assisted reproduction technology (ART). Ninety-five singleton ART pregnancies and 190 matched spontaneous pregnancies were assessed for preterm delivery rates, pregnancy complications, and cesarean section rates in a retrospective study at an academic medical center. Retrospective cohort study of 2392 singleton live births resulting from IVF/ICSI at a single large university fertility center from 2003 to 2012. Patients were stratified by day 3 or day 5/6 ET. Outcome variables included patient age, gravidity, prior miscarriages, prior assisted reproduction technology cycles, number of embryos transferred, number of single ET, infertility diagnosis, neonatal sex, GA at birth, and BW. Subanalyses were performed on subgroups of preterm infants. A comparison was made between the study data and the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) published data. Among the ART singleton deliveries group (n = 95), 19 (20%) were preterm, which was statistically significantly higher than the 4% (8 of 190) found in the control group. Among the pregnancies achieved by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in the severe male-factor infertility subgroup (n = 22), only one preterm delivery occurred (4.5%).

Recent reports have suggested that the use of indomethacin for tocolysis may independently increase the risk for major adverse neonatal events such as intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis. The objective of this study was to determine whether this potential risk of indomethacin is outweighed by the benefit of delivery delay at gestational ages<32 weeks. To study the influence on the neonate of indomethacin administered to the mother as an additional tocolytic. The neonatal outcome in 76 closely matched low birth weight infants was compared retrospectively: those whose mothers received indomethacin together with betamimetics formed the study group, those whose mothers received only betamimetics formed the control group. We constructed separate decision trees to compare strategies of tocolysis with indomethacin versus no tocolysis for hypothetic cohorts of patients with idiopathic preterm labor at 24, 26, 28, 30, and 32 weeks' gestation. Probabilities for these decision models, including estimates of indomethacin efficacy and the potential for increase in adverse neonatal events with indomethacin, were obtained from the medical literature. The primary outcome was the number of expected adverse neonatal events per 1000 women for each strategy at each gestational age. In the base case analysis tocolysis with indomethacin was a more favorable strategy than no tocolysis across all gestational ages that we studied. As expected, the difference in the number of events between the two strategies declined with advancing gestational age because of a decreasing baseline risk for adverse neonatal events as gestational age increased. The models at 26, 28, 30, or 32 weeks were not sensitive to our estimates of indomethacin efficacy, nor to our estimates of baseline neonatal morbidity or steroid efficacy, or to the relative increase in some neonatal morbidities with indomethacin use. Recent reports have suggested that the use of indomethacin for tocolysis may independently increase the risk for major adverse neonatal events such as intraventricular hemorrhage and necrotizing enterocolitis. The objective of this study was to determine whether this potential risk of indomethacin is outweighed by the benefit of delivery delay at gestational ages<32 weeks.

Context: We analyzed cases of ecthyma gangrenosum (EG) and ""ecthyma-like"" or ""ecthyma-mimicking"" cases of necrotic lesions of the skin to improve current definitions of these conditions. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare inflammatory skin condition. Two prospective studies have evaluated treatments for pyoderma gangrenosum using a primary outcome of healing speed at 6 weeks. Delineating a new exanthem is difficult. Atypical or modified types of already known conditions can easily be mistaken for new entities. We observed two patients who presented with an eczematous process, which resolved leaving residual lesions. Biopsies of the late lesions showed features of eccrine syringoma. Yet a biopsy obtained from an incipient lesion in one of the cases showed a lymphocytic inflammatory reaction of the superficial portion of the eccrine duct resulting in tortuous hyperplastic changes. It is not known whether lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis represent different clinical entities or constitute part of a spectrum of disease.

Morphological anomalies of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) cause symptomatic cerebrovascular insufficiency in 4-16% of the cases. The aim of the present study is to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic features of a group of extracranial ICA anomalies, specifically kinking, coiling, and tortuosity, eventually affecting the surgical approach. To assess a possible correlation between high blood pressure and prevalence of kinking in carotid arteries. The tortuous distal part of the ICA may have an attenuating effect on pulsatile arterial flow. We investigated local arterial blood flow patterns in the ICA proximal and distal to the carotid siphon to detect quantitative waveform changes. The classic anatomic view of the course of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and its segments familiar to neurosurgeons by a 3-dimensional microscopic cranial view may be challenging to understand when seen in the unique 2-dimensional view of transnasal endoscopic surgery. Cerebral aneurysms were induced in rats by means of the combination of ligation of the unilateral common carotid artery and induced hypertension. The ACA opposite the ligation was examined under a light microscope.

We aimed to identify hidden primary cancers in CUP patients by comparison with cancers in family members. We take use of the fact that the cause of death in CUP patients is often coded as the cancer in the organ of fatal metastasis. Patterns of subsequent malignancies in patients with cancer of unknown primary (CUP) may provide etiological insight into the primary tumor. The objective of the present study is to quantify risks of the subsequent cancers in CUP patients since such studies are lacking. Midline nodal cancer of unknown primary (CUP) has varying definitions and an unclear natural history compared to that of extragonadal germ cell cancer (EGCC) and neuroendocrine tumors. Forty-one thousand five hundred and twenty-three CUP patients were identified in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, and relative risks (RRs) were calculated for cancer in offspring when family members were diagnosed with CUP and died of the cancer diagnosed in offspring. A population-based cohort of CUP was identified from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database of year 2008. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for developing the following malignancies in 31,357 CUP patients from 1975 to 2008.

Context: The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in risk for cardiovascular disease; however, whether variability in reproductive aging relates to cardiovascular risk factors in the premenopausal period has not been studied. Controversy still exists as to the relative importance of menopausal status and lifestyle factors for the risk of coronary heart disease in women. Most of the studies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in menopause have focused on serum lipid(lipoprotein) abnormalities and were conducted in populations which were not well controlled for several important influential factors. This study examines whether patterns of worries about aging change in women during the menopausal transition. It has been widely known that cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is increased in menopause. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether this risk was elevated in young women with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR).

Rapid growth, possibly occurring in critical periods in early life, may be important for the development of obesity. It is unknown whether this is influenced by postnatal exposures such as age-relevant sources of stress. Frequent house moves may be one such stressor. We aimed to examine if there is a period of growth in early life critical for the development of child obesity by age 9 years and assess the role of house moves in modifying any relationships between early life growth and obesity at age 9 years. Childhood overweight and rapid weight gain during the first months of life have been shown to be major risk factors for the development of later overweight. Studies in children show that there are temperamental risk factors for the development of overweight, but little is known about early infancy. Nutrition during critical periods in early life may increase the subsequent risk of obesity, hypertension and metabolic diseases in adulthood. Few studies have focused on the long-term consequences of poor nutrition during the suckling period on the susceptibility to developing obesity when exposed to a palatable cafeteria-style high-fat diet (CD) after weaning. The aim of the study was to examine the association of childhood circumstances with overweight and obesity in early adulthood, to analyse whether the respondent's education and current circumstances mediate these associations, and to explore whether the respondent's health behaviour affects these associations. To investigate trends in frequency of obese children in Japan over two decades, the frequency of obese children who grow into obese adults and predictive factors for adult obesity.

Muscle strength declines with advancing age; the causes of this are uncertain. In women, strength begins to decline around the time of menopause, suggesting that hormonal changes might influence strength. To determine the effect of postmenopausal estrogen use on muscle strength, neuromuscular function, and the risk of falling, we examined 970 women aged 50-69 years who were on estrogen therapy.

Context: Various genetic and acquired factors have been proposed as being etiologically important in cortical dysgenesis. It has been suggested that fetal, developmental abnormalities may be induced by transient, circulatory instability in monochorionic twinning due to feto-fetal transfusions. We report the discordant occurrence of a malformation of cortical development in monozygotic, monochorionic twins, and discuss the findings and possible pathogenetic mechanisms. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of twin births at a tertiary care centre in Montreal, Quebec, between 1994 and 2008, extracting information, including chorionicity, from patient charts. To avoid the effect of confounding factors, we included only women with a preceding singleton pregnancy and excluded twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, fetal chromosomal/structural anomalies, fetal demise, and preterm iatrogenic delivery for reasons not encountered in both pregnancies. We used multiple regression and sensitivity analyses to determine recurrent risk factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate chorionicity and zygosity as risk factors for adverse perinatal outcomes in twins. Examine whether dichorionic (DC) and monochorionic (MC) twins exhibit different rates and severity of preeclampsia. Data on 34 monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies presenting with TTTS at stage I-II before 26 weeks of gestation were collected retrospectively (1999-2006). All patients underwent at least one amnioreduction. The outcome and the results of neurological follow-up of surviving twins were analysed in relation to the regression or progression of the disease after treatment.

Cancer pain is complex, and despite the introduction of the WHO cancer pain ladder, few studies have looked at the prevalence of adjuvant medication use in an inpatient palliative medicine unit. In this study, we evaluate the use of adjuvant pain medications in patients admitted to an inpatient palliative care unit and whether their use affects pain scores or opiate dosing. This study shows that adjuvant medications are commonly used for treating pain in patients with cancer. More than half of study population were on two adjuvants or an adjuvant plus NSAID along with an opioid. We did not demonstrate any benefit in terms of improved pain scores or opioid doses with adjuvants, but this could reflect confounding variables and physician choice. Larger prospective studies are needed to define the opioid-sparing effects of adjuvants. In this retrospective observational study, patients admitted to the inpatient palliative care unit over a 3-month period with a diagnosis of cancer on opioid therapy were selected. Data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, oral morphine dose equivalent of the opioid at the time of discharge, adjuvant analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and pain scores as reported by nurses and physicians were collected. Opioids are the mainstay of treatment of cancer pain. With increased use there have been concerns about rising rates of prescription drug abuse and diversion. Although there has been an increase in research and practice guidelines about the scope of the problem for chronic, nonmalignant pain, less information is available about both the frequency of the problem and current practices regarding screening for substance abuse and diversion in patients and family members seen in palliative care clinics. Whether intraoperative analgesics have an impact on postoperative cancer recurrence is unknown. Some investigations suggest that the opioids could favor relapse and that regional analgesia and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs could improve cancer prognosis.

77,Is gentamicin ototoxic to the fetus?,"Q: Is gentamicin ototoxic to the fetus?
Context: Helicobacter pylori is thought to be involved in atrophic body gastritis. We explored the prevalence of H. pylori infection in asymptomatic subjects with gastric parietal cell antibodies, as well as in patients with pernicious anemia, to evaluate a possible role of H. pylori gastric infection in gastric autoimmunity. Helicobacter pylori-associated corpus atrophy and autoimmune gastric atrophy share similar histopathologic and clinical aspects. In our study, the relation between Helicobacter pylori and autoimmune gastritis was investigated. Are there connections between Helicobacter pylori-induced and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal mucosal lesions leading to an increased risk? Are there any diagnostic or therapeutic consequences? Helicobacter pylori infection is a key risk factor for chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), an established precursor of gastric cancer. There is increasing evidence of frequent clearance of the infection during progression of CAG. We aimed to assess the association between host inflammatory polymorphisms and H. pylori seropositivity among CAG patients from Germany. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Several studies have indicated that the association differs with strain type. We aimed to find out if infection with strains lacking the virulence factor CagA is linked to gastric cancer risk. Helicobacter pylori is thought to be involved in atrophic body gastritis.

Patients with a rectocele often suffer from such symptoms as obstructed defaecation, urine or stool incontinence and pain. The aim of this study was to assess other concomitant pelvic floor disorders and their influence on pelvic function. This study was undertaken to assess results of surgical repair of rectocele and to identify possible determinants of outcome from patient's history and preoperative defecography. Another aim was to evaluate how surgery affects rectal evacuation. From December 2007 to November 2011, all female patients with ODS were prospectively evaluated with full interview, clinical examination and anorectal physiology testing. The characteristics of patients with and without rectoceles were compared, and logistic regression was utilized to identify factors predictive of patients having a rectocele beyond the introitus. Barium trapping within a rectocele is a criterion used by surgeons to select which patients with rectoceles should undergo operative repair. This proctographic study compared the presence and depth of barium trapping within a rectocele on postevacuation radiography with those seen on posttoilet radiography after further evacuation in the privacy of the bathroom.

79,Is surgery necessary for asymptomatic tethered cord in anorectal malformation patients?,"Q: Is surgery necessary for asymptomatic tethered cord in anorectal malformation patients?
Context: Evidence supporting routine surgery for asymptomatic tethered cord in patients with anorectal malformation (ARM) is, at best, speculative. The authors therefore examined whether untethering is indicated for asymptomatic tethered cord in patients with ARM. The aim of this study was to assess benefit of surgery in the treatment of childhood constipation in children without aganglionosis or anorectal malformations. Surgical correction of congenital anorectal malformations could be complicated by fecal incontinence. Some authors believe that preservation of the fistula is associated with improved outcome. Rectal manometry is a well-established method to evaluate postoperative functional outcome in these patients and can demonstrate successful transplantation of the fistula. Most surgeons recommend daily dilatation after surgery for Hirschsprung disease and anorectal malformations. Our goal was to critically evaluate the potential risks and benefits of this practice. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between meningocele and tethered cord syndrome, diagnosis of meningocele associated with tethered cord syndrome, and when to perform surgery and the best surgical procedure. Morphological anomalies of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) cause symptomatic cerebrovascular insufficiency in 4-16% of the cases. The aim of the present study is to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic features of a group of extracranial ICA anomalies, specifically kinking, coiling, and tortuosity, eventually affecting the surgical approach. To assess a possible correlation between high blood pressure and prevalence of kinking in carotid arteries. The tortuous distal part of the ICA may have an attenuating effect on pulsatile arterial flow. We investigated local arterial blood flow patterns in the ICA proximal and distal to the carotid siphon to detect quantitative waveform changes. The classic anatomic view of the course of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and its segments familiar to neurosurgeons by a 3-dimensional microscopic cranial view may be challenging to understand when seen in the unique 2-dimensional view of transnasal endoscopic surgery. Cerebral aneurysms were induced in rats by means of the combination of ligation of the unilateral common carotid artery and induced hypertension. The ACA opposite the ligation was examined under a light microscope.

Context: There is evidence showing that psychotherapy very often does not reach the persons most in need of it. A change in patterns of ""consumer behaviour"" is difficult to achieve on the basis of individual behavioural change. Can it be achieved by changes in legislation? This article examines whether an in-store unobtrusive survey of grocery store product displays can be used to track community-level dietary behavior. Numerous studies using hypothetical vignettes have demonstrated decision biases or deviations from utility theory. Do people who commit biases in questionnaire studies make worse real-world decisions than do less biased people? This study proves that there is a potential market, in this case in Mexico, but that it will depend on some socio-economic variables such as age, income, gender, product information, among others. Similarly, it is evident that buyers are willing to make an additional payment as compensation. Students completed an anonymous 28-item survey about their awareness, attitudes, and behaviors. Linear regression and path analysis were used to test whether attitudes were related to purchase of organic foods and eco-friendly behaviors.

Context: Cannabis use has been identified as a potent predictor of the earlier onset of psychosis, but meta-analysis has not indicated that it has a clear effect in established psychosis.AIM: To assess the association between cannabis and outcomes, including whether change in cannabis use affects symptoms and functioning, in a large sample of people with established nonaffective psychosis and comorbid substance misuse. To assess the extent to which ceasing the use of cannabis or other substances reduces the symptoms and social disability associated with psychotic illness. Cannabis use is considered a component cause of psychotic illness, interacting with genetic and other environmental risk factors. Little is known, however, about these putative interactions. The present study investigated whether an urban environment plays a role in moderating the effects of adolescent cannabis use on psychosis risk. Why patients with psychosis use cannabis remains debated. The self-medication hypothesis has received some support but other evidence points towards an alleviation of dysphoria model. This study investigated the reasons for cannabis use in first-episode psychosis (FEP) and whether strength in their endorsement changed over time. Although cannabis use among individuals with psychotic disorder is considerable, little is known about patterns of use and factors contributing to continuation of use. Therefore, we investigated craving in relation to cannabis use in patients with psychotic disorder and healthy controls.

To determine the extent to which mood in general, and depression in particular, may confound self-report measures of functional disability, pain, and global arthritis status among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to investigate the impact of depression and anxiety scores on disease activity at 1-year follow-up in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study continues an investigation into the role of decline in performance of valued life activities in the development of depressive symptoms among persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined whether declines in specific types of activities are important in the onset of depressive symptoms or whether the important factor is simply the overall burden of activity decline. Both impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on valued life activities and dissatisfaction with abilities have been linked to depression among individuals with RA. We integrated these concepts by examining the hypothesis that satisfaction with one's abilities may explain the mechanism by which the impact of RA on valued activities leads to depression.

The authors evaluated the effect of the native emphysematous lung on graft function after single lung transplantation. Lung function testing and limited HRCT scanning. The use of reduced-size adult lung transplants could help solve the profound pediatric donor lung shortage. However, adequate long-term function of the mature grafts requires growth in proportion to the recipient's development.

Surgically induced hormonal changes and the restrictive postoperative diet are proposed mechanisms. We evaluated the contribution of caloric restriction versus surgically induced changes to glucose homeostasis in the immediate postoperative period. Although medium- to long-term improvement in insulin resistance and T2DM after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is well documented, few studies have analyzed the acute effects after surgery. Understanding these effects might help explain the physiologic adjustments after surgery and help in managing insulin resistance and controlling the hypoglycemic treatment for bariatric patients. Rapid resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common feature after intestinal bypass surgery bypassing the duodenum and parts of the jejunum. However, the parameters determining the individual chance of remission are imprecisely defined. Weight loss in diabetics improves glycemic control. We investigated whether diabetes mellitus (DM) adversely affects postgastric bypass weight loss. Our database was queried for the demographics and outcomes of patients with and without DM who had undergone gastric bypass surgery.

Context: Expressed Emotions (EE) are associated with oppositional behavior (OPB) in children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). EE has been linked to altered stress responses in some disorders, but ADHD has not been studied. We test the hypothesis that OPB in ADHD is mediated by altered stress-related cortisol reactivity to EE. Low parental warmth was associated with OPB in ADHD. High levels of parental EE elicited a larger cortisol response. Stress-related cortisol reactivity mediated the EE-OPB link for all children. This highlights the general importance of parent-child interactions on externalizing behavior problems. The present study investigated the impact of coexisting anxiety disorder in children with ADHD on their ability to regulate behavior. Two groups of children (with/without ADHD) and their respective parents were randomly assigned to two different conditions with/without negative emotion and participated in an emotion provocation task. Parents' EE, their ratings of their children's OPB and their children's salivary cortisol levels were measured. To test whether deficits in executive function and delay aversion make independent contributions to levels of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms exhibited by preschool children.

Muscle strength declines with advancing age; the causes of this are uncertain. In women, strength begins to decline around the time of menopause, suggesting that hormonal changes might influence strength. To determine the effect of postmenopausal estrogen use on muscle strength, neuromuscular function, and the risk of falling, we examined 9704 participants aged 65 years or more enrolled in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Current use of postmenopausal estrogens was associated with a decreased risk of more severe nuclear sclerosis. Younger age at menarche was also associated with a protective effect regarding nuclear sclerosis. Older age at menopause was associated with a decreased risk of cortical opacities. We compared cognitive function between postmenopausal women with breast cancer before the initiation of systemic adjuvant therapy and healthy age- and education-matched postmenopausal women and examined whether factors related to lifetime exposure to hormones predicted cognitive function before therapy. We evaluated reports of counseling on estrogen and bone loss from 1404 women aged 40-60 who reported any counseling on HRT in the 1994 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We also examined the association between these reports and sociodemographic factors, adjusting for clinical history, physician specialty, and physician visits.

Context: Prior in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that external ultrasound accelerates thrombolysis at intensities too low to have a direct effect on clot dissolution in the absence of a thrombolytic agent. The present study was undertaken to examine the ultrasound effect on thrombolysis and reocclusion in a rabbit thrombosis model. Recently, 3 clinical trials revealed encouraging results in recanalization and clinical outcome in acute stroke patients when 2-MHz transcranial Doppler monitoring was applied. This study investigated whether a 1.8-MHz commercial diagnostic ultrasound device has the potential to facilitate thrombolysis using an in vitro stroke model. Thrombosis is one of the most important causes of morbidity in the medical field. Several independent in vitro studies have shown that the fibrinolytic process may be enhanced by ultrasound, but the effect of ultrasound on thrombus formation in vivo is unexplored. The present study was designed to investigate this matter. In thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke, it is essential to obtain rapid thrombolysis before ischemic neuronal injury occurs. To develop a new technique of thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke, the effect of transcranially applied ultrasound (TUS) on thrombolysis was examined. The same mechanisms by which ultrasound enhances thrombolysis are described in connection with non-beneficial effects of ultrasound. The present safety study was therefore designed to explore effects of beneficial ultrasound characteristics on the infarcted and non-infarcted myocardium.

We found an association between the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA both in osteoporotic bone tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and the increase in circulating resorptive cytokines. Our study was designed to determine whether C. pneumoniae infection may be involved in osteoporosis-associated bone loss. The results of sero-epidemiologic studies of the relation between Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherogenesis vary considerably. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate the overall odds ratio (OR) and to identify potential sources of variability. The authors recently pointed out an epidemiological relation between specific anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies and peripartum cardiomyopathy in Niamey (Republic of Niger). To investigate the possible relationship between atherothrombotic stroke and Chlamydia pneumoniae. The relationship between growth hormone (GH) therapy and malignancy, including leukaemias, remains controversial. In order to study this possible relationship further, we have investigated whether GH treatment induces chromosomal abnormalities in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The proportion of cells with chromatid and chromosome breaks ranged from 0% to 6% in patients before treatment and from 1% to 5% in controls. During GH therapy the incidence of aneuploid metaphases ranged from 0% to 7% and was comparable with values observed in controls. Chromosomal loss and gain was random. To determine whether birth size, postnatal growth and growth during growth hormone (GH) treatment, were associated with IGF1 gene polymorphisms and haplotypes. Congenital growth hormone deficiency is associated with aberrant androgen physiology and micropenis. We investigated whether treatment with growth hormone alone is adequate to restore normal phallic growth. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not imatinib mesylate therapy induces growth hormone (GH) deficiency in patients with recurrent, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Context: Current clinical guidelines require that five indices (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio) be measured or calculated to assess the lipid-related risk of vascular disease. All five are also targets of therapy and therefore all must be measured initially and at follow-up. Considerable evidence indicates that apolipoprotein B (apo B) is a better index of reaching or not reaching treatment targets than total or LDL cholesterol. Patients with increased numbers of cholesterol-depleted apolipoprotein B (apoB) particles frequently have multiple other abnormalities, which might confound the comparison of apoB and non-high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) as markers of cardiovascular risk. To evaluate whether apolipoproteins A-I (Apo A-I) and B (Apo B) have, higher ensitivity (SN), specificity (SP) and positive predictive value (PPV) than lipoproteins (LP), total cholesterol (TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and triglycerides (TGL) in assessing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The objective of this study was to examine whether measurement of a single marker (apo B) led to the same categorization of risk as the traditional five indices (lipid profile). If both apo B and lipid profile indicated that the patient was either within or outside their respective treatment targets, the indices were considered concordant. If not, the indices were considered discordant. Concordance/discordance was examined in 215 patients at their first and last clinic visit.

Context: It has been suggested that hospital admission during weekends poses a risk for adverse outcomes and increased patient mortality, the so-called 'weekend effect'. We undertook an evaluation of the impact of weekend admissions to the management of polytraumatised patients, in a Level I Major Trauma Centre (MTC) in the UK. Many previous studies have shown that patients admitted to hospital at weekends have worse outcomes than those on other days. It has been proposed that parity of clinical services throughout the week could mitigate the 'weekend effect'. This study aimed to determine whether or not a weekend effect is observed within an all-hours consultant-led major trauma service. Occurrence on weekends or at night has been associated with poor outcomes for time-sensitive conditions including ST elevation myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest. We sought to determine whether the ""weekend effect"" exists for injured patients at our trauma center. We performed a retrospective cohort study at a Level I trauma center (2006-2008). The relative risks of mortality associated with weekend or night arrival were estimated using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. All trauma patients included in the dataset with the injury mechanism of burn divided into ""off-hours"" admits (nights from 6pm to 6am and weekends) and weekday admits.

Context: This study focuses on sex differences in depression of the widowed. Previous research showed different results in sex differences and in depression after bereavement. We assessed the effects of widowhood on depressive symptoms for men and women and examined whether environmental strain like social support, finances and housekeeping concerns explain these effects. The results show that widowhood is associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms and that this association is stronger for men than for women. The effect of widowhood is mediated by different types of environmental strain for men and women. However, a strong direct main effect of widowhood on depression remains. The difference in depression rates between men and women is most evident among those widowed for a longer period of time. Women report higher rates of depression and anxiety than men; however, it is uncertain whether this gender difference continues into advanced old age. It is not well-established whether excess mortality associated with depression is higher in men than in women. Overall, women reported higher levels of depression than men. Individuals with higher depression scores were more lonely and had higher stress levels than individuals with lower scores. Women with higher depression scores were more likely to report coming from abusive situations, to have poor social support from family and to be unemployed when compared to women with lower scores, but similar differences were not found when comparing men with higher and lower depression scores.

Context: Muscle strength declines with advancing age; the causes of this are uncertain. In women, strength begins to decline around the time of menopause, suggesting that hormonal changes might influence strength. To determine the effect of postmenopausal estrogen use on muscle strength, neuromuscular function, and the risk of falling, we examined 9704 participants aged 65 years or more enrolled in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Current use of postmenopausal estrogens was associated with a decreased risk of more severe nuclear sclerosis. Younger age at menarche was also associated with a protective effect regarding nuclear sclerosis. Older age at menopause was associated with a decreased risk of cortical opacities. We compared cognitive function between postmenopausal women with breast cancer before the initiation of systemic adjuvant therapy and healthy age- and education-matched postmenopausal women and examined whether factors related to lifetime exposure to hormones predicted cognitive function before therapy. We evaluated reports of counseling on estrogen and bone loss from 1404 women aged 40-60 who reported any counseling on HRT in the 1994 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We also examined the association between these reports and sociodemographic factors, adjusting for clinical history, physician specialty, and physician visits.

Depressive complaints and somatic morbidity were both positively related to general health care utilization. Somatic morbidity has an attenuating effect on the impact of depressive complaints: If it becomes more severe, the impact of depressive complaints on utilization is reduced. Depressive complaints are especially related to the use of paramedic services, use of prescription drugs, and consultations of medical specialists. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of depressive complaints and chronic medical illnesses on prospective somatic health care utilization and the possible heterogeneity of the effect of depressive complaints across levels of medical illness severity. We evaluated the relationship between somatic symptoms and depressive conditions among patients visiting the general medicine clinic of a university hospital. Data from a community-based sample of adults (n=9428) were used, of whom a health survey and claims data, indicating health care use, were available. Assessments of depressive complaints and somatic illnesses were based on self-report. Binomial regression analyses were used to study the expected relations. Depressed subjects use more health care resources than those affected by chronic somatic disorders or healthy subjects.

Context: After an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, the uninjured contralateral lower limb may become weakened because of neuromuscular changes, proprioceptive deficits, and disuse of the limb; this weakness predisposes the limb to ACL injury. However, no results have been reported regarding weakness in the contralateral limb after ACL injury. Muscle strength and functional status of the contralateral lower limb are reduced after unilateral ACL injury. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether knee anterior laxity changes after anterior cruciate ligament injury and surgery are related to aspects of thigh muscle resistance training during rehabilitation. To evaluate the effects of wearing a functional knee brace and muscle fatigue on hamstring reflex time in subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency. Functional instability after anterior cruciate ligament injury can be successfully treated with ligament reconstruction. However, the associated meniscus and cartilage lesions often cannot be repaired and may have long-term detrimental effects on knee function.

Interestingly, the effects on programmed cell death seem to be cell dependent, with a higher rate of apoptosis in thymocytes but decreased apoptosis in neutrophils . Overall, the C5ainduced changes point toward an enhanced susceptibility toward infections, as well as to a prolonged presence of neutrophils resulting in an exaggerated inflammatory response and host damage.', 'The involvement of platelets in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications is supported by several studies.

Context: Since 1995 GINA (Global Initiative on Asthma) guidelines for asthma management have been updated annually and published in order to promote better management of asthma in real life situations. The aim of our study was to assess the level of implementation of GINA Guidelines among Italian Pulmonary Specialists (PSs). A study was undertaken to assess whether the therapeutic aspects of published international asthma management guidelines are practically applicable in developing countries. A detailed questionnaire was sent to 296 Respiratory Units (RUs) in Italy in order to collect information about personnel involved in the management of asthma patients, availability and use of diagnostic tools, recommended treatment according to the degree of asthma severity, educational activity. Data were analysed by using the SPSS programme. Guidelines for asthma management have been developed both locally and internationally. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence of primary care physicians in the National Guard Iskan Primary Care Center to these guidelines. A cross-sectional study was designed in the territory-level referral hospital in northern Malaysia. Twenty-seven EPs were asked to complete an asthma guideline questionnaire to assess their knowledge regarding GINA 2011 asthma treatment guidelines. A total of 810 patients were enrolled, and 30 patients were selected per physician. The authors evaluated the physicians' compliance with GINA 2011 asthma treatment guidelines.

Context: The increase in the number of anterior lumbar interbody fusions being performed carries with it the potential for the long-term complication of adjacent segmental degeneration. While its exact mechanism remains uncertain, adjacent segment degeneration has become much more widespread. Using a nonlinear, three-dimensional finite element model to analyze and compare the biomechanical influence of anterior lumbar interbody fusion and lumbar disc degeneration on the superior adjacent intervertebral disc, we attempt to determine if anterior lumbar interbody fusion aggravates adjacent segment degeneration. The intradiscal pressure, intersegmental rotation, and tresca stress of L3-L4 segment in mild degeneration microdiscectomy model are higher than those in the mild degeneration model under all motion directions. The above parameters in moderate degeneration microdiscectomy model present a similar trend to the mild degeneration microdiscectomy model. However, the intersegmental rotation of L3-L4 in moderate degeneration microdiscectomy model is lower than that in the moderate degeneration model in lateral bending, and the intradiscal pressure of L3-L4 in moderate degeneration microdiscectomy model is lower than that in the moderate degeneration model in axial rotation. Forty-one patients with one level lumbar DSD and initial disc degeneration at the adjacent level were treated. Circumferential lumbar arthrodesis and posterior hybrid instrumentation were performed to preserve an initial disc degeneration above the segment that has to be fused. Clinical and spino-pelvic parameters were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. In the 82 patients who underwent a lumbar fusion, no difference in outcome was found between those patients with degenerative or symptomatic discs adjacent to the fusion and those with normal adjacent discs. Microdiscectomy is a common surgical procedure used to treat lumbar disc herniation. Following microdiscectomy, the space of the excised nucleus pulposus is replaced by fibrocartilaginous granulation tissue. This results in alterations of both the material properties of the intervertebral disc and the biomechanics of the lumbar motion segments, potentially contributing to adjacent segmental disc degeneration.

Context: There is evidence showing that psychotherapy very often does not reach the persons most in need of it. A change in patterns of ""consumer behaviour"" is difficult to achieve on the basis of individual behavioural change. Can it be achieved by changes in legislation? This article examines whether an in-store unobtrusive survey of grocery store product displays can be used to track community-level dietary behavior. Numerous studies using hypothetical vignettes have demonstrated decision biases or deviations from utility theory. Do people who commit biases in questionnaire studies make worse real-world decisions than do less biased people? This study proves that there is a potential market, in this case in Mexico, but that it will depend on some socio-economic variables such as age, income, gender, product information, among others. Similarly, it is evident that buyers are willing to make an additional payment as compensation. Students completed an anonymous 28-item survey about their awareness, attitudes, and behaviors. Linear regression and path analysis were used to test whether attitudes were related to purchase of organic foods and eco-friendly behaviors.

Context: Esophageal intubation with a bougie during laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) is commonly used to prevent an excessively tight wrap. However, a bougie may cause intraoperative gastric and esophageal perforations. We hypothesized that LNF is safe and effective when performed without a bougie. It has been claimed that oesophageal intubation with a bougie during laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) reduces the risk of a tight crural repair and wrap, and thereby decreases the prevalence of post-operative dysphagia. The aim of this study is to assess the benefit of routinely inserting a bougie during LNF, in relation to post-operative dysphagia. In recent years, day-case laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) has became popular. Our study aims to evaluate the effect of patient factors and severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease measured by DeMeester score on the success of day-case LNF. From 1997 to 1999, a randomized trial was set up to compare 98 patients who had undergone laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) with 79 patients treated with conventional Nissen fundoplication (CNF). All patients were requested to complete a questionnaire, before and 3, 6, 12, 24 and 60 months after surgery. A subgroup of 87 patients agreed to undergo objective evaluation by pH-metry. The results of all these assessments were correlated with the effect of surgery on the Visick score. A total of 905 patients (209 with respiratory symptoms, mainly cough) underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication. Preoperatively patients underwent esophageal motility studies, 24-h pH monitoring, and symptom evaluation using a validated scale. Of eligible patients, 81% were followed at 6 months, 73% at 2 years, and 60% at 5 years.

Context: Off-pump trans left ventricular approach provides more precise deployment of stented aortic valve of any size with respect to the endovascular replacement. One of the key steps of this procedure is the ventricle repair after catheter withdrawing. We designed an animal study to compare the consistency of a sutureless repair of the left ventricle access using nitinol occluder with and without pericardial cuff on the ventricular side. The impact of sutureless prosthesis on the clinical outcome in minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is still unclear. We assessed mid-term outcomes of the sutureless and conventional valves implanted through right anterior minithoracotomy. Despite the progress made in the development of valved stents for trans-apical valve replacement, a reliable closure of the access orifice remains a major issue. The present study was designed to evaluate if device closure of the ventricular wall is safe. We performed direct closure of doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defects with aortic cusp prolapse. Postoperative echocardiographic studies showed that this method improved coaptation of the prolapsing aortic cusp, especially in patients with mild aortic regurgitation (AR). Forty-two patients undergoing elective, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized into two groups: 20 patients underwent closure of the pericardium (Closure group) and the pericardium was left open in 22 patients (Open group). Radiopaque markers were attached to the anterior aspect of the right ventricular epicardium in both groups.

Radiopaque markers were attached to the anterior aspect of the right ventricular epicardium in both groups. The aim of this study was to assess whether adenosine impairs left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained with gated SPECT in patients with a normal myocardial perfusion scintigram. Conflicting data exist about the difference between 8- and 16-frame gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction (EF); moreover, the influence of framing on detection of stress-induced functional changes is unknown. To determine whether echocardiography and radionuclide angiography give comparable results when the left ventricular ejection fraction is measured early after myocardial infarction and thus whether, irrespective of the method used, a single value for the ejection fraction could be used as a guide for starting treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. This study sought to assess the diagnostic value of myocardial perfusion imaging during exercise and pharmacologic stress in patients with left bundle branch block. This prospective study included 160 consecutive patients with a normal myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), who were stressed with either exercise (n = 64) or with adenosine (n = 96). Student t-test or chi test was used to compare patient's characteristics and functional parameters. Linear regression analyses were used to assess which patient characteristics had an independent significant influence on LVEF. The aim of this study was to assess whether adenosine impairs left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) obtained with gated SPECT in patients with a normal myocardial perfusion scintigram. Conflicting data exist about the difference between 8- and 16-frame gated single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) left ventricular volumes and ejection fraction (EF); moreover, the influence of framing on detection of stress-induced functional changes is unknown.

105,Chemical lipid extraction or mathematical isotope correction models: should mathematical models be widely applied to marine species?,"Q: Chemical lipid extraction or mathematical isotope correction models: should mathematical models be widely applied to marine species?
Context: Chemical lipid extractions, as means of standardizing sample preparations, have been identified as important for comparability of studies. Unfortunately, these methods are expensive, because of the costly chemicals and the need to analyse two sets of samples, one for δ(13) C values (treated) and another for δ(15) N values (untreated). To avoid this, studies have suggested mathematical solutions to the problem. Our study intends to (i) determine the applicability of the five most common mathematical correction models and (ii) which of the widely applied chemical extraction methods is the most suitable for a variety of marine organisms. The results indicated that the mathematical methods could not be accurately applied to any of the eight species used in this study, highlighting current issues with accepted isotope methodologies. The Folch chemical extraction removed the highest amount of lipid, suggesting it is the most suitable delipidation method. We found that chemical lipid extraction is unnecessary for Brook Trout white muscle tissue with low initial lipid content. However, in tissues with C:N ratios greater than 3.5, lipid extraction increased δ(13) C values in fish liver by more than 1.0 ‰, indicating that liver lipid content is sufficient to bias δ(13) C values. We also found that lipids were accurately accounted for with mathematical normalization and recommend that tissues with C:N ratios greater than 3.5 be corrected mathematically. Muscle, heart and liver samples were collected from eight different species. The tissues were treated with Bligh and Dyer, Folch and Soxhlet extraction methods and analysed in a Europa 20-20 mass spectrometer. Predicted lipid-extracted δ(13) C values were calculated from untreated tissue values using the five most common mathematical models. The use of dispersants can be an effective way to deal with acute oil spills to limit environmental damage, however very little is known about whether chemically dispersed oil have the same toxic effect on marine organisms as mechanically dispersed oil. We exposed Atlantic cod larvae to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil for four days during the first-feeding stage of development, and collected larvae at 14 days post hatch for transcriptional analysis. A genome-wide microarray was used to screen for effects and to assess whether molecular responses to chemically and mechanically dispersed oil were similar, given the same exposure to oil (droplet distribution and concentration) with and without the addition of a chemical dispersant (Dasic NS).

The existing detection methods can be divided into two levels: generic and specific. Generic detection gives information about whether the particles are biological materials, microbes or living cells, e.g. bioluminescent measurement of ATP using continuous flow luminometer and mass-spectrometry. Specific methods such as micro-arrary and immuno-assays can tell us what kind of microbes are detected and identified.

However, each PCR reaction only provides identification of one specific virus, or a group of related viruses. Thus, a clinical hypothesis regarding the suspected pathogen needs to guide the decision as to which PCR analyses to perform, resulting in a large number of PCR protocols needed to facilitate the identification of all human pathogens.', 'Title: Viral infection detection using metagenomics technology in six poultry farms of eastern China\nPassage: Animal disease surveillance is fundamental for animal disease prevention and control, and it is also a tool to get the information used to make decisions about control and eradication strategies.

For example, nucleic acid detection by quantitative PCR is extremely rapid and sensitive, but provides simultaneous results on a limited number of primer pair-determined genomic regions. In contrast, traditional culture-based, phenotypic methods are often limited by lengthy incubation periods, but allow for the identification of multiple pathogens and are currently considered the gold standard in clinical microbiology laboratories.', 'Title: Insights into the Evolution and Emergence of a Novel Infectious Disease\nPassage: Our work raises important questions for future research: where should surveillance be focused to detect an emergence as early as possible, especially if resources are limited? Given emergence of a novel infection in a rural setting, how much time can we buy through limiting travel to and from major urban centres? These and other questions will undoubtedly benefit from more systematic studies of emergence in the context of population distributions.

First, it does not consider the epidemic network topology. However, how to infer such networks is another challenging task.

108,Does increased superficial neck flexor activity in the craniocervical flexion test reflect reduced deep flexor activity in people with neck pain?,"Q: Does increased superficial neck flexor activity in the craniocervical flexion test reflect reduced deep flexor activity in people with neck pain?
Context: The craniocervical flexion test assesses the deep cervical flexor muscles (longus capitis, longus colli). Ideally, electromyography (EMG) studies measure activity in both deep and superficial (sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene) flexors during the test, but most studies confine recordings to superficial muscle activity as the technique to record the deep muscles is invasive. Higher activity of the superficial flexors has been interpreted as an indicator of reduced deep flexor activity in people with neck pain but how close the inverse relationship is during this test is unknown. EMG was recorded from the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene and deep cervical flexor muscles to quantify their relationship during the craniocervical flexion test, from 32 women (age: 38.0 ± 11.6 yrs) with a history of chronic non-specific neck pain.

A moderate negative correlation was identified (r = -0.45; P < 0.01) between the average normalized EMG amplitude of the deep cervical flexors and sternocleidomastoid across all stages of the craniocervical flexion test.

To study the relation between neck pain and work related neck flexion, neck rotation, and sitting. A repeated-measures study design with one week between testing sessions was used. Nineteen healthy asymptomatic subjects and 19 subjects with chronic neck pain participated in the study. The neck movements measured were: flexion, extension, right and left lateral flexion, and axial rotation. PPTs were measured over six bilateral sites, both local and remote to the cervical spine. The craniocervical flexion test assesses the deep cervical flexor muscles (longus capitis, longus colli). Ideally, electromyography (EMG) studies measure activity in both deep and superficial (sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene) flexors during the test, but most studies confine recordings to superficial muscle activity as the technique to record the deep muscles is invasive. Higher activity of the superficial flexors has been interpreted as an indicator of reduced deep flexor activity in people with neck pain but how close the inverse relationship is during this test is unknown. EMG was recorded from the sternocleidomastoid, anterior scalene and deep cervical flexor muscles to quantify their relationship during the craniocervical flexion test, from 32 women (age: 38.0 ± 11.6 yrs) with a history of chronic non-specific neck pain.

There is currently an increasing emphasis on accident prevention as part of routine child health surveillance, which unlike opportunistic accident prevention has the potential to reach the whole population. However, non-attenders at routine child health surveillance may also be children at higher risk of accidental injury, as there is some evidence that non-attenders may be more likely to live in socio-economic disadvantage, which is a risk factor for accidental injury. Parents of children aged 3-12 months registered with practices participating in a controlled trial of injury prevention in primary care that did, and did not, respond to the baseline survey and who subsequently attended child health surveillance checks. Cross sectional survey at baseline compared with safety practices reported at subsequent child health surveillance checks. To investigate the effect of quantity and quality of early child care on children's risk for unintentional injury. A cross-sectional computer and telephone survey was conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial. The authors enrolled parents of children being seen at an urban pediatric primary care practice and measured selected injury knowledge, beliefs and safety practices.

However, non-attenders at routine child health surveillance may also be children at higher risk of accidental injury, as there is some evidence that non-attenders may be more likely to live in socio-economic disadvantage, which is a risk factor for accidental injury. Parents of children aged 3-12 months registered with practices participating in a controlled trial of injury prevention in primary care that did, and did not, respond to the baseline survey and who subsequently attended child health surveillance checks. Cross sectional survey at baseline compared with safety practices reported at subsequent child health surveillance checks. To investigate the effect of quantity and quality of early child care on children's risk for unintentional injury. A cross-sectional computer and telephone survey was conducted as part of a randomized controlled trial.

Similarly, it is evident that buyers are willing to make an additional payment as compensation. Students completed an anonymous 28-item survey about their awareness, attitudes, and behaviors. Linear regression and path analysis were used to test whether attitudes were related to purchase of organic foods and whether the relationship was mediated by attitudes. The results showed that attitudes were related to purchase of organic foods, but the relationship was mediated by attitudes. The results suggest that attitudes are related to purchase of organic foods, but the relationship is mediated by attitudes.","['While concerns about road rage have grown over the past decade, states have made it easier for motorists to carry firearms in their vehicles.

111,Next day discharge after elective intracranial aneurysm coiling: is it safe?,"Q: Next day discharge after elective intracranial aneurysm coiling: is it safe?
Context: To compare the surgical outcomes of combined corneal-incision cataract surgery and viscocanalostomy (phaco-VCS) with or without the adjunctive peeling of juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) in 136 patients of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In a prospective clinical trial, 63 eyes underwent phaco-VCS (Peeling (-) group), and 73 eyes underwent phaco-VCS with the peeling of JCT (Peeling (+) group). The postoperative IOP, the probability of successful IOP reduction without medications, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. The study goal was to determine whether creating a subperiosteal tunnel before lateral osteotomy had an effect on postoperative periorbital edema, ecchymosis, and subconjunctival ecchymosis. This study compares the frequencies of traumatic wound dehiscence following extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and following phacoemulsification through a self-sealing corneoscleral tunnel. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of reduced postoperative follow-up after phacoemulsification using a scleral tunnel technique.

Context: We analyzed data from 2 EQ-5D valuation studies where, using similar time trade-off protocols, values for 42 common health states were elicited from representative samples of the US and UK general adult populations. First, US and UK population mean valuations were estimated and compared for each health state. Second, random-effect models were used to compare the US and UK valuations while adjusting for known predictors of EQ-5D valuations (ie, age, sex, health state descriptors) and to investigate whether and how the valuations differ. We sought to compare directly elicited valuations for EQ-5D health states between the US and UK general adult populations. Population mean valuations of the 42 health states ranged from -0.38 to 0.88 for the United States and from -0.54 to 0.88 for the United Kingdom, with the US mean scores being numerically higher than the UK for 39 health states (mean difference: 0.11; range: -0.01 to 0.25). After adjusting for the main effects of known predictors, the average difference in valuations was 0.10 (P<0.001). The magnitude of the difference in the US and UK valuations was not constant across EQ-5D health states; greater differences in valuations were present in health states characterized by extreme problems. Most US studies that estimate EQ-5D index score generally apply the UK preference weights. We compared the validity of a newly-developed US weights to the UK weights for use of EQ-5D as a measure of health-related quality of life. Preferences for EQ-5D-5L health states were elicited from a broadly representative sample of members of the UK general public. Respondents valued EQ-5D-5L health states using TTO and DCE methods across one of three dimension orderings via face-to-face computer-assisted personal interviews. Differences in mean values and the size of the health dimension coefficients across the arms were compared using difference testing and regression analyses.

Context: Functional MRI combined with electromyography (EMG-fMRI) is a new technique to investigate the functional association of movement to brain activations. Thalamic stereotactic surgery is effective in reducing tremor. However, while some patients have satisfying benefit, others have only partial or temporary relief. This could be due to suboptimal targeting in some cases. By identifying tremor-related areas, EMG-fMRI could provide more insight into the pathophysiology of tremor and be potentially useful in refining surgical targeting. Aim of the study was to evaluate whether EMG-fMRI could detect blood oxygen level dependent brain activations associated with tremor in patients with Essential Tremor. Second, we explored whether EMG-fMRI could improve the delineation of targets for stereotactic surgery. Simultaneous EMG-fMRI was performed in six Essential Tremor patients with unilateral thalamotomy. EMG was recorded from the trembling arm (non-operated side) and from the contralateral arm (operated side).

Context: Following a prior report of the SDHD M1I mutation in an Australian Chinese family, a second Chinese family with the same mutation is reported. The proband developed bilateral head and neck paragangliomas at age 34 years and a functioning adrenal pheochromocytoma and two extra-adrenal abdominal paragangliomas 7 years later. His brother had unilateral head and neck paraganglioma at age 39 years. Given the multicentricity of the proband's tumor and the familial clustering of paragangliomas, a clinical diagnosis of hereditary paraganglioma was made, and the proband was tested for a mutation in the SDHD gene. Hereditary paraganglioma is a rare condition that is inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Four distinct loci have been associated with hereditary paraganglioma, including the SDHD, SDHC, and SDHB genes and a locus at 11q13. The SDHD, SDHC, and SDHB genes code for subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, which forms part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. SDHD mutations are widely distributed along the gene with no apparent hot spots, although a founder effect has been described in the Dutch population. The proband was found to be heterozygous for the SDHD MII mutation that removes the start codon, and his brother subsequently tested positive for the same mutation. The family is not related to the Australian Chinese family. Mutations in the subunits B, C, and D of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) mitochondrial complex II have been associated with the development of paragangliomas (PGL), gastrointestinal stromal tumors, papillary thyroid and renal carcinoma (SDHB), and testicular seminoma (SDHD).AIM: Our aim was to examine the possible causative link between SDHD inactivation and somatotropinoma. A germline mutation in one of the five susceptibility genes (VHL, RET, SDHD, SDHC, SDHB) was identified in eight patients (8%) with an age of onset between 13 and 57 years. Among them, six had a bilateral pheochromocytoma and only two had a unilateral tumour. If the guidelines for genetic screening were age of onset less than 50 or bilateral pheochromocytoma, no patients with a hereditary tumour would be missed and a 24% cost reduction would be achieved.

It is caused by the deletion of the survival motor neuron 1 gene in more than 95% of SMA patients . Humans have a second nearly identical copy of this gene, SMN2 .

We used a prospective observational study at the ED of a tertiary teaching hospital over a 6-month period. Uni- and multivariate assessments of factors related to loss of independence were examined. To investigate the predictive value of self-reported decline in weight, exhaustion, walking difficulty, grip strength and physical activity on development of disabilities in community-dwelling elderly people. To determine if there is a relationship between body mass index and the ability to perform the usual activities of living in a sample of community-dwelling elderly. To determine whether information about an older person's physical functioning provided to the patient and his or her physician delays functional decline and improves health outcomes.

There is evidence showing that psychotherapy very often does not reach the persons most in need of it. A change in patterns of ""consumer behaviour"" is difficult to achieve on the basis of individual behavioural change. Can it be achieved by changes in legislation? This article examines whether an in-store unobtrusive survey of grocery store product displays can be used to track community-level dietary behavior. Numerous studies using hypothetical vignettes have demonstrated decision biases or deviations from utility theory. Do people who commit biases in questionnaire studies make worse real-world decisions than do less biased people? This study proves that there is a potential market, in this case in Mexico, but that it will depend on some socio-economic variables such as age, income, gender, product information, among others. Similarly, it is evident that buyers are willing to make an additional payment as compensation. Students completed an anonymous 28-item survey about their awareness, attitudes, and behaviors. Linear regression and path analysis were used to test whether attitudes were related to purchase of organic foods and eco-friendly behaviors.

Good functional performance in elderly people greatly improves their changes of independence and well-being. Conversely, bad functional performance can impair their capability of managing the activities of daily life.. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effects of a 6-months' multimodal training intervention on the physical performance of males and females, possible gender differences and the outcome 6 and 12 months after its completion. Low levels of physical activity (PA) and poor fitness tend to predict a decline in mobility. The current study investigated whether PA modifies the predictive value of health-related fitness (HRF) tests on difficulty in walking 2 km (WD). The health benefits of bicycling in older adults with mobility limitation (ML) are unclear. We investigated ML and functional capacity of older cyclists by evaluating their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), intellectual activity, and social function. Functional ability. A significant deterioration of functional abilities can be noticed after the age of 40 and it becomes even more severe after 60. A negative assessment of musculoskeletal functions was declared by 70% of the investigated arthritis elderly people. Respondents did not take into account cognitive dissonance when comparing themselves with a peer group. That is why every second patient considered himself mobile enough for his/her age. A low functional assessment relates significantly to the awareness of having arthritis.

Context: Angel's trumpet (Species Brugmansia) is widely used as a garden plant because it is easily kept and the luxuriance of its flowering. Belonging to the Family Solanacea it contains a large amount of alkaloids (parasympatholytics). Because of its hallucinogenic action, its leaves and flowers are increasingly used by young people as a substitute for the hallucinogen LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide). In the summer of 1997, one of a group of youths died after they had ingested its flowers which they had gathered from front gardens. An investigation was undertaken to identify the alkaloids and measure their concentration in the various parts of the plant. To evaluate acute toxic effects of Euphorbia helioscopia in order to assure the safety and usefulness of herbal remedy. Species of Aristolochia are associated with aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), a renal interstitial fibrosis and upper urinary tract cancer (UUC). Aristolochic acid nephropathy has been reported in ten countries but its true incidence is unknown and most likely underestimated. By combining an ethnobotanical and phytochemical approach we provide evidence for the risk of AAN occurring in Bangladesh. More specifically, we assess the intra-specific variation of aristolochic acid analogues in medicinally used Aristolochia indica samples from Bangladesh. To evaluate the possible antiulcer effect of the African garden egg, Solanum aethiopicum (S. aethiopicum) (a domestic vegetable) experimentally in rats. Roots as well as leaves are commonly used for symptoms such as snake bites and sexual problems. Among the informants knowledge about toxicity or side effects is very limited and Aristolochia indica is often administered in very high doses. Replacement of Aristolochia indica with other medicinal plants such as Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz was common. Aristolochia indica samples contained a variety of aristolochic acid analogues such as aristolochic acid I, aristolochic acid II, cepharadione A and related compounds.

121,Recruiting doctors from and for underserved groups: Does New Brunswick's initiative to recruit doctors for its linguistic minority help rural communities?,"Q: Recruiting doctors from and for underserved groups: Does New Brunswick's initiative to recruit doctors for its linguistic minority help rural communities?
Context: Within health care, there are underserved groups. New Brunswick's French-speaking minority, which also mostly lives in rural communities, is one such group. A physician shortage potentially prevents this population from accessing health promotion and clinical prevention services. This study analyzes whether New Brunswick Francophone doctors with rural backgrounds are more likely than doctors from urban regions to set up practice in rural communities of the province. A questionnaire was sent to 390 New Brunswick Francophone physicians admitted in medicine between 1973 and 2000. It collected information on geographic origin and history of medical practice. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify whether a rural background is associated with the likelihood of ever and currently practicing in rural communities. We used the General Practice Rurality Index-simplified to quantify the rurality level of communities. A major goal of the Faculty of Medicine at the Memorial University of Newfoundland is to produce physicians who will return to rural areas that are currently underserviced. Research shows that the strongest indicator of practice in a rural area is a rural background, and thus it is important that rural students apply to medical school. We investigated what high school students believe to be preventing them from pursuing medical education. Research suggests that Canadian francophones living in minority contexts have little access to health services in French and are more likely to receive poorer health services. We examined whether francophones in one Nova Scotia (NS) community showed different patterns of health service use from anglophones in similar rural communities, or the NS population overall. To determine whether rural practice terms for junior doctors result in increased interest in rural practice and whether these terms improve learning experiences, clinical skills and insight into difficulties of rural practice.

Male adolescents underutilize youth health centers' (YHC) services despite facing a variety of significant health issues. The purpose of our study was to explore adolescent males' perceptions of health service needs, utilization of YHC services, and barriers and facilitators for such utilization as a function of school grade among a sample of males from rural Nova Scotia in Canada. The outcomes evaluation compared a cohort of students attending 19 participating schools and a national sample of urban youths, using logit models to control for observed differences between the two groups of youths. Outcome measures included self-reports concerning health center utilization, use of other health care providers, knowledge of key health facts, substance use, sexual activity, contraceptive use, pregnancies and births, and health status. The health centers increased students' access to health care and improved their health knowledge. However, the estimated impacts on health status and risky behaviors were inconsistent, and most were small and not statistically significant. To determine if high levels of perceived parental supervision and communication were associated with reduced gonorrhea (GC) and chlamydia (CT) incidence in low-income, African American, sexually experienced female adolescents, aged 14 to 19 years, attending urban health clinics. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to 305 adolescents, ages 11 to 16 years, waiting to be seen in three community health centers and three private practices. The questionnaire queried adolescents' willingness to talk about eight preventive counseling topics with health care practitioners, and information was collected on the number of times each topic was discussed.

Context: Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder, which results from interaction of exogenous and endogenous factors. One of these environmental factors is viral infections particularly, herpesviruses. We aimed to detect the presence of HSV 1 and 2 (herpes simplex virus) and HHV8 (human herpesvirus 8) in our patients who were suffering from pemphigus vulgaris. In this cross-sectional study, 38 patients (19 male and 19 female patients) with pemphigus vulgaris were entered, 32 skins and six peripheral blood cells samples were obtained from the study population. Thereafter, the presence of HHV8 and HSV DNA were evaluated by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifty-two cases of pemphigus were identified, 47 of pemphigus vulgaris and five of pemphigus foliaceus; and of these 13 developed acanthomata when the blisters healed. Ten of these cases were of pemphigus vulgaris and three were of pemphigus foliaceus; biopsy of these lesions showed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, papillomatosis, and intraepidermal clefting. Immunofluorescence carried out in two of these acanthomata also showed intercellular fluorescence. Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases targeting the cell-cell adhesion molecules, desmogleins (Dsgs). Anti-Dsg antibodies, the hallmark of the disease, were not detected in normal individuals in many populations. In spite of the rarity of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) disease in many parts of the world, PV is not rare in Egypt. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the presence of anti-Dsg3 antibodies in normal Egyptians aiming to determine the reason for the increase in number of patients in Egypt with pemphigus.

Several viruses such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus and others are known to induce ER stress and UPR signalling pathways . While some of them such as influenza virus and rotavirus manipulate these UPR pathways to establish its productive infection many viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Tula virus succumb to its activation due to cross activation of UPREs .

We demonstrate for the first time that the ire-1 -xbp-1 arm of the UPR is functionally important for defense against a pathogenic attack since loss of this pathway leads to animals hypersensitive to PFT, but not to other toxic insults. Furthermore, we demonstrate that activation of the ire-1-xbp-1 pathway by PFT requires p38 MAPK and its associated MAPK kinase and that the in vivo response of the UPR to a PFT can be separated from', 'Title: Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Defenses against Bacterial Pore-Forming Toxin In Vivo\nPassage: A link between the p38 and UPR pathways has been shown in previous studies, although not with the level of functional relevance demonstrated here. Various arms of the UPR have been shown as both upstream or downstream of the p38 pathway, depending on the circumstances . The p38 pathway itself is implicated extensively in innate immune protection of many organisms against pathogens and against PFTs in worms and mammals .

The activation of the PERK or the combined activation of PERK and IRE1a pathways can lead to enhanced ER protein folding capacity and clearance of misfolded ER proteins or provoke innate immune response against viral proteins. However, depending on the strength of UPR activation, the cells can no longer have the opportunity to restore cellular homeostasis and may eventually lead to apoptosis.

Hantaviruses are segmented, RNA viruses that cause lifelong infections in their reservoir rodent hosts, despite high levels of neutralizing antibodies . Pathogen recognition receptors, such as RIG-I and TLR7, are not elevated in the lungs of infected rats, suggesting that evasion of viral recognition may contribute toward the establishment of a persistent infection. Perhaps, the reason for noninduction of RIG-I is the fact that hantaviruses do not produce detectable amounts of dsRNA .

As cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are recruited to sites of infection, they undergo the process of transendothelial cell migration, which is highly regulated by integrins, cadherins, and junctional adhesion molecules to prevent vascular leakage during the process . Hantaviruses inactivate and dysregulate beta 3 integrins and VE-cadherin , making it possible that infected endothelial cells may not be able to reform junctional complexes following paracellular diapedesis, leading to vascular leakage.

In inbred laboratory mice, the virus produces strain-dependent disease profiles that depend on the infection route, age, genetic background, and immune status of the host. For example, Balb/c, C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice develop acute fulminant hepatitis, while C3H mice develop a mild chronic disease and mice of the A strain exhibit no evidence of hepatitis .

Hippocampus volumetry is a useful surrogate marker for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our purpose was to compare visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy made by radiologists with automatic hippocampal volume and to compare their performances for the classification of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN). Many reports support the clinical validity of volumetric MRI measurements in Alzheimer's disease. Visual assessment of medial temporal lobe atrophy was correlated with hippocampal volume (p < 0.01). Classification performances between MCI converter and CN was better using volumetry than visual assessment of non-expert readers whereas classification of AD and CN did not differ between visual assessment and volumetry except for the first reading of one non-expert (p = 0.03). We studied 30 CN, 30 MCI and 30 AD subjects. Six radiologists with two levels of expertise performed two readings of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Medial temporal lobe atrophy was evaluated on coronal three-dimensional T1-weighted images using Scheltens scale and compared with hippocampal volume obtained using a fully automatic segmentation method (Spearman's rank coefficient). Intraclass correlation tests show that almost perfect agreement between repeated measurements of both segmented brain parenchyma fraction and regional measurement of hippocampi. The protocol is suitable for both global and regional volumetric measurements of medial temporal lobe atrophy. The results of this study suggest that the use of automatic volumetric measurements of medial temporal lobe atrophy can be a useful tool for the diagnosis of AD and MCI.

Context: Dysarthria is one of the first sign of neurological Wilson's disease and is often characterized by a decreased speech rate. The aim of this study is to determine the abilities of Wilson's disease dysarthric patients to control their speech rate. We examined the impact of dual-tasking on the speech rate of patients as compared to healthy control speakers and in relation with their ability to accelerate speech rate when instructed to do so. A significantly slower speech rate was observed for all patients as compared to controls. In the dual-task conditions, while the speech rate of healthy speakers accelerated significantly, two behaviors are found for the patients. Forty-two percent of the patients reproduced the control pattern with a significant increased in speech rate, while the other group significantly decreased their speech rate. Comparison of the ability of the two groups to intentionally modulate speech rate, when instructed to accelerate, shows that significantly better acceleration was achieved by speakers in the former group compared with the latter. To determine whether knowledge of medical diagnosis biases listeners with varied experience levels in their judgments of dysphonia. Twenty-six patients and twenty-six age- and sex-matched healthy controls repeated a sentence during 20 seconds at a comfortable speech rate used as reference. They were then asked to perform the same repetition task but in dual task conditions, in which sentence repetition was done while performing three types of executive grapho-motor tasks. Finally, the ability to control speech rate was tested by asking the speakers to perform the sentence repetition task alone but at a fast rate of speech.

In addition to Koen, there is a reference to an infection with influenzalike disease in swine near the China-Russia border during the second global wave of the pandemic during October 1918 and an independent description of influenza in European swine in 1918 by Altmann Aladar, a Hungarian veterinarian .', 'This study was designed to: (i) determine if the priority of referral letters by general practitioners to a plastic surgery skin lesion clinic adhered to the national guidelines, what happened to these patients, and what was the histological diagnosis; and (ii) analyse whether the prognosis at diagnosis of malignant melanoma had improved since the introduction of the 2-week wait for patients with suspected cancer.', 'Skin disorders account for over 20% of GP consultations.

Context: Numerous studies indicate that certain genetic polymorphisms modify lead toxicokinetics. Metallothioneins are protective against the toxicity of many metals, including lead. The aim of this study was to determine whether the maternal metallothionein 2A (MT2A) -5 A/G single-nucleotide polymorphism is related to the lead levels in maternal blood, placental tissue and cord blood in 91 pregnant women and their newborns. Venous blood from the mother was collected to investigate lead levels and MT2A polymorphism. Cord blood and placenta were collected for lead levels. Analyses were made using an Atomic Absorption Graphite Furnace Spectrophotometer. Standard PCR-RFLP technique was used to determine MT2A polymorphism. Blood lead levels of heterozygote genotype (AG) mothers were statistically higher than those of homozygote genotype (AA) (P<0.05). Maternal lead levels were significantly associated with cord blood lead levels for pregnant women with AA genotype (P<0.001). This association was not statistically significant for pregnant women with AG. In contrast, the mean value of cord blood lead level for newborns with mothers of AG genotype was slightly higher than others, though the difference was not significant.

Passage: infection transfers to another group, new growth will emerge. Studies have shown that embryo metabolism and cell cleavage after warming vitrified embryos is faster than after thawing frozen embryos. We study vitrified embryo transfer (VET) results depending on the developmental stage of warmed embryos and the duration of progesterone treatment before embryo transfer. The clinical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed in three groups according to endometrial preparation (natural cycle group [n = 34], ovulation induced [n = 21], and artificial cycles [n = 70]) among women that underwent vitrified blastocyst stage ET. Transfer of cryopreserved-warmed embryos into an appropriately prepared uterus unaffected by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is common in the practice of in vitro fertilization. There is limited information on the effect of blastocyst vitrification and warming on perinatal outcomes. Vitrification technology presents new opportunities for preservation of embryo derived stem cells without first establishing a viable ESC line. This study tests the feasibility of cryopreserving ICM cells using vitrification. Cleavage stage embryos from 526 thaw cycles previously cryopreserved by either the conventional two-step slow freezing method or the modified one-step method were studied. The embryo and blastomere survival rates, cleavage rate, clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate were compared between the two groups.

We observed over 70% of our B pertussis cases over a 1-year period.

The effect of donor kidney volume on recipient kidney function has not been fully evaluated. Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a congenital malformation of the hindgut characterized by the absence of enteric ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses. Hirschsprung's disease is routinely treated by resection of the aganglionic bowel and pull-through procedure of the proximal ganglionated bowel to the anorectal region. Occasionally, after resection of the aganglionic bowel, HD patients still experience persistent disturbances in gut motility. The etiology of HD as well as the underlying pathomechanism for postoperative disturbances in gut motility is unclear. Molecular analysis of putative candidate genes may help to clarify the pathophysiology of these conditions. In the present study, we investigated the correlation between mutations and polymorphisms in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) and HD patients. Aberrant neural crest migration is implicated in the pathogenesis of hindgut aganglionosis in Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR). Neural crest progenitors also give rise to a variety of cell types outside the gut, including nerves of the inner ear and peripheral nervous system. This study aims to determine whether such nerves are also affected in HSCR. In histological studies, there are no significant differences between the transitional segment (TS) of Hirschsprung's disease (HD) and the diseased segment in patients with hypoganglionosis (Hypo). In contrast, there are no reports whether or not TS show impaired motility like Hypo. Nitric oxide (NO) has recently been shown to be a neurotransmitter in the non-adrenergic noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory nerves in the human gut. To clarify the significance of NO in TS and Hypo, enteric nervous responses in colonic tissue obtained from TS and Hypo were investigated. Compared with HV, mast cells, T cells, and macrophages were decreased in IBS patients. Similarly, λ-free light chain (FLC)-positive mast cells were decreased but not immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and IgG-positive mast cells. There were no differences between hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS patients. No relation was found between any of the immune cells studied and the thresholds of discomfort, urge, first sensation, or IBS symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, stool-related complaints, bloating). Finally, stress-related symptoms and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis response to stress were not correlated with the number of mast cells or the presence of visceral hypersensitivity. This study investigated responses of the enteric nervous system including NANC inhibitory nerves in colonic tissue obtained from TS in 10 patients with HD (8 boys and 2 girls, aged from 6 months to 2 years) and diseased colon in 6 patients with Hypo (6 boys, aged from 6 months to 2 years).

In particular the study tried to answer the question whether the AquaPORT technology can safely prevent angle closure glaucoma. From March 2012 to November 2013, 24 eyes from 12 patients suffering from a high myopia (-8.75 ± 4.37 D, maximum -22.75 D) underwent implantation of a posterior chamber implantable phakic collamer intraocular lens (ICL) with AquaPORT technology in the Homburg/Saar refractive surgery center.

136,Mosaicism for combined tetrasomy of chromosomes 8 and 18 in a dysmorphic child: a result of failed tetraploidy correction?,"Q: Mosaicism for combined tetrasomy of chromosomes 8 and 18 in a dysmorphic child: a result of failed tetraploidy correction?
Context: In a markedly dysmorphic child with heart malformations and developmental delay, CGH analysis of newborn blood DNA suggested a 50% dose increase of chromosomes 8 and 18, despite a normal standard karyotype investigation. Subsequent FISH analysis revealed leukocytes with four chromosomes 8 and four chromosomes 18. The child's phenotype had resemblance to both mosaic trisomy 8 and mosaic trisomy 18. The double tetrasomy was caused by mitotic malsegregation of all four chromatids of both chromosome pairs. A possible origin of such an error is incomplete correction of a tetraploid state resulting from failed cytokinesis or mitotic slippage during early embryonic development. An abnormal result was obtained in 190 cases, including 124 trisomies, 21 sex chromosome anomalies, 14 triploidies, and 31 rearrangements or mosaics. All trisomies were detected by all three techniques, but triploidies were only detected by karyotyping and QF-PCR. In 19 of the 31 cases of rearrangements or mosaicism there was an uncertain or high risk of adverse outcome. Traditional karyotyping detected 13 of the 19 pathogenic rearrangements, MLPA detected 18, and QF-PCR did not detect any. Mosaic whole-chromosome tetrasomy has not previously been described as a cause of fetal malformations. We present a chromosomally normal fetus with severe acrofacial dysostosis and orofacial clefts. These were bilateral transverse and oblique clefts and defects of the midface. In addition, there were preaxial limb anomalies with digitalization of thumbs and internal cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and urogenital malformations. The mother had been treated with high doses of the immunosuppressant mycophenolate mofetil in early pregnancy for systemic lupus erythematosus. Advanced maternal age and increased Down's risk with maternal serum marker were the most common indications. Chromosome abnormalities were detected in 3.64% of the pregnancies tested, and unexpected structural anomalies in 0.63% (n = 36). Translocations were more likely to be reciprocal, balanced and of parental origin. There were 6 mosaic gonosomal aneuploidies. Overall, 4 mosaic autosomal aneuploidies and 36 structural aberrations would not have been recognised by RAS alone. Of the 4 mosaic autosomal aneuploidies, all were terminated, one had major malformations and the others had discrete signs that a good quality ultrasound examination would probably not detect. Of the 36 structural aberrations, 24 would be undetected by ultrasound scan, from which 6 would be associated with a significant risk of an abnormal phenotype outcome.

The Early vs Late Infantile Strabismus Surgery Study Group investigates whether early or late surgery is preferable in infantile convergent strabismus, in a non-randomised, prospective, multicentre clinical trial. The current state of the study after end of recruitment is reported here, focusing on the question of possible sources for bias in this non-randomised trial. To investigate the incidence of infantile esotropia from a defined population in the United States over a 30-year period. Recent reports from the United Kingdom have suggested that strabismus or strabismus surgery is occurring less frequently today than in previous years. A longitudinal prospective study was carried out to ascertain the significance of neonatal ocular misalignments. Pre-school vision screening and hospital records were examined to determine the visual outcome of 1150 infants classified into 'often' (>15% of waking hours), 'occasionally' (<15%) or 'never' having an ocular misalignment (neonatal squint) in the first 8 weeks of life. Chi2 and Fisher's exact tests and ANOVA were used to analyse the data. To evaluate the role of achieving immediate target angles on the success of strabismus surgery.

Passage: of these genes is regulated post-transcriptionally in response to the host. Most Crohn's disease (CD) patients show seroreactivity against Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP), suggesting a pathogenic role for this organism. Our aim was to seek amino acid similarities between MAP and intestinal proteins that, through molecular mimicry, could serve as targets for cross-reactive immunity in CD. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose whether a patient has intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease because both have similar clinical, pathologic, and endoscopic features. However, their therapies are completely different and a mistake in diagnosis can result with deterioration. Many laboratory methods for the diagnosis of tuberculosis require considerable time to receive a diagnostic result. We wanted to evaluate whether an immunohistochemical tuberculosis staining method can be helpful for faster differentiation of biopsy materials. There are few widely accepted criteria other than caseation, which has low sensitivity, for differentiating intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD). Antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies to Saccharomyces cerevisiae for Crohn's disease in an Italian population and to evaluate their clinical role.

Context: The beneficial short- and long-term renoprotective effects of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition are lower in albuminuric diabetic patients homozygous for the deletion compared to the insertion polymorphism of the ACE gene. In an attempt to overcome this interaction, we evaluated the short-term renoprotective effect in diabetic nephropathy of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan in patients homozygous for the insertion or the deletion allele. A total of 54 hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy homozygous for the insertion (n = 26) or the deletion (n = 28) allele were included in the study. After a 4-week washout, the patients received losartan (tablet, 100 mg o.d.) and were followed prospectively with a mean follow-up period of 36 months. Patients and investigators were blinded to ACE genotypes. At baseline, after 2 and 4 months and every 6 months thereafter, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), albuminuria, and 24-h blood pressure were determined. Fifty-four hypertensive type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy homozygous for the insertion (I; N = 26) or the deletion (D; N = 28) allele of the ACE/ID polymorphism were included. After four weeks of washout, the patients received losartan 50 mg daily followed by 100 mg in two treatment periods each lasting two months. Patients and investigators were blinded to ACE genotypes. At baseline and in the end of the treatment periods, 24-hour blood pressure, albuminuria and glomerular filtration rate values were determined. Several observational follow-up studies have found that the D allele of the insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism of the ACE gene (ACE/ID) is associated with an increased risk of renal function loss, even during ACE inhibition. Therefore, we investigated the long-term effect of the angiotensin II subtype-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan (100 mg o.d.) on kidney function in II and DD type 1 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy. Recent reports indicate increased risk of renal failure with long-term use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in diabetes. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetes has increased despite ACEI and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use. This study questions renal protection by ACEI or ARB. Our hypothesis is that uncontrolled hyperglycemia is central to diabetic ESRD while tight glucose control is renoprotective. Cultured endothelial cells show morphological damage that increases with duration of exposure to high glucose and is prevented by insulin and more so by a combination of insulin and heparin.

144,Can we identify metabolically healthy but obese individuals (MHO)?,"Q: Can we identify metabolically healthy but obese individuals (MHO)?
Context: A unique subset of obese individuals termed, Metabolically Healthy but Obese (MHO), has been described in the literature. However, there is no agreed upon method to identify MHO individuals for research protocols or in clinical practice. Therefore, we examined a large cohort of obese older women to attempt to develop a first set of clinical markers that may identify MHO individuals. A subgroup of obese patients without metabolic disorders has been identified and defined as metabolically healthy but morbidly obese (MHMO). Some obese individuals have no cardiometabolic abnormalities; they are 'metabolically healthy, but obese' (MHO). Similarly, some non-obese individuals have cardiometabolic abnormalities, that is, 'metabolically at risk, normal weight' (MANW). Previous studies have suggested that early-onset obesity may be associated with MHO. We aimed to assess whether body mass index (BMI) in childhood and early-onset obesity are associated with MHO. Individuals with metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) do not have the metabolic complications usually associated with obesity. 297 of 1097 (27.1%) of obese men were metabolically healthy; 826 of 1295 (63.8%) non-obese men had at least one metabolic abnormality. There was no evidence that rapid BMI growth in childhood or early-onset obesity was associated with either MHO or the MANW phenotype, for example, among obese men in mid-life, the OR for MHO comparing early-onset obesity with non-early-onset obesity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.10).

Overweight and obesity are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There is also an association between body mass index (BMI) and cognitive ability. Since low birth weight is associated with adult metabolic disease, particularly in obese subjects, the question emerges whether obesity has an additional negative effect on cognitive function in subjects with low birth weight. The aim was to analyse whether overweight or obesity influence intellectual performance in young adults with particular focus on those with a low birth weight. The risk for low intellectual performance was higher for those with high BMI compared to those with normal. The highest risk was found among subjects with low birth weight and overweight or obesity in young adulthood (odds ratios, 1.98 [1.73-2.22] and 2.59 [2.00-3.34], respectively). However, subjects with further high birth weight and a high BMI at conscription had no further increased risk. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether adolescent pregnancy is a risk factor for low birth weight (LBW) babies. Individuals born at low or high birth weight (BW) have elevated adiposity.

Context: CD44, an integral membrane glycoprotein, may have an important role in early tumorigenesis, specifically, facilitating early tumor progression. Reports of the expression of CD44 in early uterine cervical squamous carcinogenesis are conflicting. We examined the expression of CD44 in microinvasive carcinoma of the cervix (MIC), as yet unreported, and compared it to that in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1 and CIN 3 to further elucidate its role in early squamous carcinogenesis. Intestinal metaplasia is a well-established risk factor in the development of stomach cancer. However, since the specificity is low it would be of great practical value to find a marker to separate cases of intestinal metaplasia into low and high risk for progression to dysplasia/carcinoma. So far this has not been achieved. CD44 is a cell surface molecule involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and the spliced variant 6 has been shown to play a role in the progression of gastric carcinoma. The aim of this study was therefore to evaluate CD44v6 as a marker of increased cancer risk in intestinal metaplasia. Nup88 is overexpressed in a number of types of carcinomas and is associated with myometrial invasion, but its exact expression pattern in endometrial cancer and premalignant lesions is unknown. There was a significant sequential increase in CD44v6 expression from normal mucosa and mucosa showing intestinal metaplasia to uninvolved mucosa adjacent to cancers without and with intestinal metaplasia to tumour. The most striking increase was from 'normal' to intestinal metaplastic mucosa adjacent to cancers. There were no differences between proximal and distal cases in any group. We aimed to identify if there is any predictor of residual disease at repeat operation after cervical conization with positive surgical margins for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or microinvasive cervical cancer.

Context: The African-American-white mortality gap for males in the United States is 6 years in favor of whites. Participation in professional sport may moderate this ethnic disparity. The historical cohort of professional basketball players, with nearly equal numbers of African-American and white players, can provide a natural experiment that may control for the classic confounders of income, education, socioeconomic status (SES), and physical factors related to mortality. The objectives of this study are to assess mortality and calculate survival for the overall study population and within ethnicity. The final dataset included 3366 individuals, of whom 56.0% were African American. Results suggest white players live 18 months longer than their African-American colleagues. African-American players gained 9 years on their respective referent and live longer than white men in the general public. After controlling for covariates, we found that African-American players have a 75% increased risk of death compared with white players, a statistically significant gap (p<.0001, 95% confidence interval 1.41-2.44). From 1980-99, adults aged 45-64 experienced a 22% decline in mortality and, consequently, over 1720 lives were ""saved"" annually in Wisconsin in this age group between 1995-1999. Mortality in black men and women declined 8% and 10% respectively in this interval as compared to 27% for white males and 19% for white females (P<0.05 for all groups for temporal change in death rates). Significant declines in cardiovascular and cancer mortality were achieved. Deaths from injuries increased slightly. The black to white mortality ratio is projected to increase by 2010. Wisconsin and the United States have reduced mortality in the age group 15-24 by about 17% and 16%, respectively, between 1980-1984 and 1995-1999. In spite of this overall progress, significant disparities still exist between white and black older adolescents and young adults. When compared to 1980-1984, Wisconsin mortality rates for 1995-1999 were 24% lower among whites, but 73% higher among blacks. Disparities still exist when rates are analyzed by the leading causes of deaths. Deaths due to motor vehicle injuries have decreased for whites by about 31% compared to an increase of 19% for blacks.

The underuse of effective contraceptive methods by women at risk for unintended pregnancy is a major factor contributing to the high rate of unintended pregnancy in the United States. As health care providers are important contributors to women's contraceptive use, this study was conducted to assess provider knowledge about contraception. Our study aims were to: (1) describe the scope of contraceptive methods provided by US family medicine educators and (2) assess the extent to which US family medicine educators' recommendations regarding eligibility criteria for contraceptive methods are consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. In Serbia, gynaecologists could play an important role in achieving the transition from an abortion-based family planning culture to a modern contraception-based one. Exploring their knowledge, attitudes and practice regarding birth control is of particular importance for ensuring the quality of contraceptive counselling. Studies have shown poor knowledge of oral contraceptives among women attending government health clinics and women in rural areas. Little is known about the level of contraceptive knowledge in educated, affluent, career-orientated women, although it could be expected that access to information would be greater. The study objective was to describe the profile, knowledge and understanding of oral contraceptive users in a private general practice in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Context: Depression occurs commonly in coronary artery disease (CAD) and is associated with substantial disability. Modifiable cognitive determinants of depression in this population have not been identified. We investigated the impact of potentially modifiable illness beliefs about CAD on depressive symptomatology. We also examined the association between these beliefs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and socio-demographic variations in illness beliefs. Negative illness beliefs, particularly those associated with the consequences of CAD, were significantly predictive of higher levels of depressive symptomatology at 3 and 9 months. Positive illness perceptions were significantly associated with better HRQOL outcomes. Older and less socially advantaged patients demonstrated more negative illness beliefs. Depression is common in people with coronary heart disease (CHD) and predicts worse cardiac outcomes. Cognitive and behavioral mechanisms have been proposed to explain this association, although the mediating role of these mechanisms remains unclear. We conducted a prospective cohort study to investigate whether the impact of depression on subsequent impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was mediated by cognitive and behavioral pathways. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which illness perceptions predict attendance at cardiac rehabilitation and quality of life following myocardial infarction (MI). In contrast to previous work reported in this area, illness perceptions were not significantly associated with attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. Illness perceptions measured within 24 h of an acute MI were predictive of quality of life 6 months later.

To determine the extent to which mood in general, and depression in particular, may confound self-report measures of functional disability, pain, and global arthritis status among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed to investigate the impact of depression and anxiety scores on disease activity at 1-year follow-up in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This study continues an investigation into the role of decline in performance of valued life activities in the development of depressive symptoms among persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined whether declines in specific types of activities are important in the onset of depressive symptoms or whether the important factor is simply the overall burden of activity decline. Both impact of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on valued life activities and dissatisfaction with abilities have been linked to depression among individuals with RA. We integrated these concepts by examining the hypothesis that satisfaction with one's abilities may explain the mechanism by which the impact of RA on valued activities leads to depression.

Our objective was to examine whether repeated measures over time of risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, blood pressure, total cholesterol and body mass index) explain more of the socioeconomic gradient in CVD mortality than if they are measured only once.', 'The probability of death (in %) decreased from 1984 to 2001 by 11% in men. However, it remained stable for women. On the other hand the probability of cardiovascular death decreased by 25% and 33%, respectively. The main role in global risk decrease was played by beneficial trends in mean systolic blood pressure (in both genders) and percentage of smokers in men.']"
153,Is dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI useful for assessing proximal fragment vascularity in scaphoid fracture delayed and non-union?,"Q: Is dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI useful for assessing proximal fragment vascularity in scaphoid fracture delayed and non-union?
Context: This study aimed to determine whether anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and knee laxity are improved 2 years after ACL rupture treated nonoperatively and to analyze the relation between changes in scores of ACL features and changes in laxity. Previous studies indicate that isolated posterior cruciate ligament injuries demonstrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical evidence of healing when treated nonoperatively; however, the authors are unaware of any other study that has looked at whether initial MRI can predict posterior cruciate ligament stability at the time of surgery in patients with knee dislocation. The present study was performed to determine whether MRI findings can predict the degree of knee joint laxity in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction and whether the accuracy of the prediction is affected by the MRI acquisition time. We sought to clarify the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MR) to show partial anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures and to allow distinction of partial from complete ACL ruptures. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showing an ""intact"" anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft may not correlate well with examination findings. Reasons for an ACL graft dysfunction may be from malpositioned tunnels, deficiency of secondary stabilizers, repeat injuries, or a combination of factors.

Increasing infarct mass is associated with impaired prognosis in chronic ischemic heart disease. Global strain by echocardiographic assessment relates closely to infarct mass assessed by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging but requires deformation analysis in a 16-segment model of the left ventricular. Mitral annular (MA) displacement reflects longitudinal left ventricular deformation and could provide similar information. Global longitudinal strain and MA displacement by Doppler tissue imaging were assessed in 61 patients 9 months after first myocardial infarctions and compared with global myocardial infarct mass assessed using contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Long axis strain (LAS) has been shown to be a fast assessable parameter representing global left ventricular (LV) longitudinal function in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). However, the prognostic value of LAS in cardiomyopathies with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) has not been evaluated yet. In 47 healthy subjects left ventricular (LV) two-dimensional (2D) peak strain and time to peak strain (TTP) generated by EchoPAC (2DS) and velocity vector imaging (VVI) were compared. For each type of strain (longitudinal [LS], circumferential [CS], and radial strain [RS]) we compared global, anatomical level and segmental values. Both indices significantly separated medium-sized infarcts from small or large infarcts (P<.05) and correlated significantly with global infarct mass (P<.01 for both). There was a good correlation between global strain and MA displacement (r = 0.65, P<.01).

Context: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits in the presence of conduct problems are associated with increased risk of severe antisocial behavior. Developmentally sensitive methods of assessing CU traits have recently been generated, but their construct validity in relation to neurocognitive underpinnings of CU has not been demonstrated. The current study sought to investigate whether the fear-specific emotion recognition deficits associated with CU traits in older individuals are developmentally expressed in young children as low concern for others and punishment insensitivity. Children with callous-unemotional (CU) traits, a proposed precursor to adult psychopathy, are characterized by impaired emotion recognition, reduced responsiveness to others' distress, and a lack of guilt or empathy. Reduced attention to faces, and more specifically to the eye region, has been proposed to underlie these difficulties, although this has never been tested longitudinally from infancy. Attention to faces occurs within the context of dyadic caregiver interactions, and early environment including parenting characteristics has been associated with CU traits. The present study tested whether infants' preferential tracking of a face with direct gaze and levels of maternal sensitivity predict later CU traits. Using data from 5,923 mother-child pairs participating in The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, the authors tested the outcomes of internalizing difficulties and callous-unemotional traits (based on mother report at age 13) via the predictors (at ages 8 and 10) of irritability (mother report) and the experience of peer victimization (youth report). Oppositional defiant disorder children, assessed for callous-unemotional (CU) traits, and controls, were observed in a brief interaction task where the mother was asked to show love to her child. Eye contact and affection were measured for each dyad. A subsample of 337 preschoolers (mean age 4.8 years, SD = 0.8) who completed neurocognitive tasks was taken from a larger project of preschool psychopathology. Children completed an emotional recognition task in which they were asked to identify the emotional face from the neutral faces in an array. CU traits were assessed using the Low Concern (LC) and Punishment Insensitivity (PI) subscales of the Multidimensional Assessment Profile of Disruptive Behavior (MAP-DB), which were specifically designed to differentiate the normative misbehavior of early childhood from atypical patterns. Callous-unemotional (CU) traits in the presence of conduct problems are associated with increased risk of severe antisocial behavior.

Context: Whether right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) pacing is superior to right ventricular apex (RVA) pacing in terms of ventricular synchrony, cardiac function, and remodeling in patients with normal cardiac function is still unknown. Right ventricular outflow tract pacing is superior to RVA pacing in patients with normal cardiac function. We are aimed to investigate whether right ventricular mid-septal pacing (RVMSP) is superior to conventional right ventricular apical pacing (RVAP) in improving clinical functional capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) for patients with high-degree atrio-ventricular block and moderately depressed left ventricle (LV) function. Right ventricular pacing may be deleterious in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, but in patients with normal function the impact of this stimulation triggering clinically relevant ventricular dysfunction is not fully established. A total of 96 consecutive patients with high or third-degree atrial ventricular block were enrolled and randomized into 2 groups: RVOT pacing group (n = 48) and RVA pacing group (n = 48). Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and 2D echocardiography were performed to study left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic synchrony, LV volumes, and function. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is considered to be the result of an arrest in the normal myocardial embryogenesis. The histological, developmental, and electrophysiological explanation of ventricular arrhythmias in NCCM is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the origin of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in NCCM and to identify any predominant arrhythmic foci. Retrospective data from our NCCM registry including 101 patients were analyzed. A total number of 2069 electrocardiograms (ECGs) were studied to determine the origin of PVCs. Echocardiographic data were analyzed in patients with PVCs in all 12 leads. Segments affected by noncompaction (NC) were compared with the origin of PVCs. Isolated left ventricular non-compaction is the result of incomplete myocardial morphogenesis, leading to persistence of the embryonic myocardium. The condition is recognized by an excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle. Whether these intertrabecular recesses are a favorable substrate for ventricular arrhythmias is unclear. Some reports have found that the fatal ventricular arrhythmias may occur in approximately half of the patients. In this report we investigated about this association. Five patients with nonischemic and five with ischemic cardiomyopathy due to anterior myocardial infarction were enrolled. No correlation was observed between values of repolarization among patients. The optimal values of repolarization were significantly different from values of echocardiographically guided hemodynamic optimization. Two patients with biventricular pacing-induced ventricular fibrillation were successfully treated by reprogramming of V-V delay according to interventricular delay resulting in shorter Tpeak-Tend interval, although delayed effect of amiodarone in one of these patients cannot be ruled out. Noncompaction of left ventricular myocardium is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from an incomplete myocardial morphogenesis that leads to the persistence of the embryonic myocardium. This condition is characterized by a thin compacted epicardial and an extremely thickened endocardial layer with prominent trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses. It is not clear, in noncompaction of myocardium, whether intertrabecular recesses could be responsible for thrombi formation and thromboembolic complications.

Context: This study aims to assess the relevance of the definition of acute dissection, to analyse whether there is a sub-acute phase and to determine early outcome of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in acute complicated type B aortic dissection. Patients with type B aortic dissection differ from patients with type A dissection in age, hypertension prevalence, indications and timing of surgical treatment, yet reported long-term results have been rather similar (see Doroghazi et al. J Am Coll Cardiol 1984;3:1026-1034). Acute aortic dissection is usually presented as a surgical emergent condition with high mortality rate. Whether any patient of an advanced age suffering from acute aortic type A dissection or complicated type B dissection should be referred for surgery still deserves debating. Impact on survival of different treatment strategies was analyzed in 571 patients with acute type B aortic dissection enrolled from 1996 to 2005 in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. The extent of proximal and distal aortic resection that should be performed for acute type A aortic dissections remains controversial.

J Am Coll Cardiol 1984;3:1026-1034). Acute aortic dissection is usually presented as a surgical emergent condition with high mortality rate. Whether any patient of an advanced age suffering from acute aortic type A dissection or complicated type B dissection should be referred for surgery still deserves debating. Impact on survival of different treatment strategies was analyzed in 571 patients with acute type B aortic dissection enrolled from 1996 to 2005 in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection. The extent of proximal and distal aortic resection that should be performed for acute type A aortic dissections remains controversial. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent cause for emergency hospital admission. Most severity scores include in their computation the endoscopic findings. The Glasgow-Blatchford score is a validated score that is easy to calculate based on simple clinical and biological variables that can identify patients with a low or a high risk of needing a therapeutic (interventional endoscopy, surgery and/ or transfusions).AIM: To validate retrospectively the Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS). The Glasgow Blatchford Score (GBS) is a validated prognostic score for patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (UGIB). The score predicts the need for therapeutic intervention or death, and studies have suggested that outpatient management is safe for patients with a GBS of zero. Our aim was to assess whether we could safely extend the threshold for outpatient management to patients with GBS≤1. The Glasgow-Blatchford score (GBS) has been validated to select severe patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (UGIH). The aim was to compare the yield of the triage based on the GBS with an endoscopist' decision to perform an urgent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) in newly admitted patients and inpatients with UGIH in the setting of an endoscopy on-duty service in 13 tertiary care centers. The Glasgow Blatchford score (GBS) is a pre-endoscopic risk assessment tool for patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. There are few data regarding use in patients with variceal bleeding, who are generally accepted as being at high risk.AIM: The aim of the study was to assess GBS in correctly identifying patients with subsequently proven variceal bleeding as 'high risk' and to compare GBS, admission and full Rockall scores in predicting clinical endpoints in this group. Risk stratification of patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) using either Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) or preendoscopy Rockall score to facilitate early safe discharge (GBS=0, pre-Rockall=0) has been reported.

Context: To assess whether bowel preparation prior to kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) radiography and intravenous urography (IVU) are of value in improving visualization of the urinary system. A prospective, randomized, single blind, controlled trial was performed to determine whether routine bowel preparations are necessary for satisfactory visualization of the urinary system during IVP and compare the side effects of several bowel preparation methods. The purpose of this study was to determine whether routine bowel preparation with laxatives and dietary restrictions (liquid supper and fasting after midnight) are necessary for satisfactory visualization of the urinary system during excretory urography in outpatients. To assess, in a blinded study, the usefulness of bowel preparation in improving the quality of radiography of the renal tract in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

The aim of our study was to evaluate the use of thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) in acute pain management after cardiac valve replacement and determine if the incidence of chronic pain related to the sternotomy was reduced by the use of TEA. This patient group was chosen to exclude pain related to the use of the internal mammary artery and angina pectoris. Thoracic surgery is associated with severe acute postoperative pain, leading to pulmonary complications and hyperalgesia-induced chronic pain. Thoracic patient-controlled epidural analgesia is also considered as the gold-standard postoperative analgesia. As previously described in major digestive surgery, combination with low-dose intravenous (i.v.) ketamine could potentiate epidural analgesia and facilitate pulmonary function recovery following thoracotomy. Patients scheduled for elective cardiac valve replacement were offered TEA. A match-control group was selected.

161,Does the evidence for spinal manipulation translate into better outcomes in routine clinical care for patients with occupational low back pain?,"Q: Does the evidence for spinal manipulation translate into better outcomes in routine clinical care for patients with occupational low back pain?
Context: Previous research has identified clinical characteristics of patients who are likely to respond favorably to thrust manipulation. The application of this evidence and its effect on clinical outcomes among patients with occupational low back pain has not been examined. Meta-analysis methodology was extended to derive comparative effectiveness information on spinal manipulation for low back pain. Determine relative effectiveness of spinal manipulation therapies (SMTs), medical management, physical therapies, and exercise for acute and chronic nonsurgical low back pain. Spinal manipulation has undergone a resurgence of interest. Developing evidence suggests a relationship between safety, skill and clinical outcome. Training programs are variable and range from extensive formalized curricula to weekend seminars and individual demonstrations. Systematic study of a relationship between prerequisites and skill development has not been conducted. The literature often refers to a recent rise in occupational low back pain. However, the question is: Do empirical data support this notion? Previous research has identified clinical characteristics of patients who are likely to respond favorably to thrust manipulation. The application of this evidence and its effect on clinical outcomes among patients with occupational low back pain has not been examined.

Determine relative effectiveness of spinal manipulation therapies (SMTs), medical management, physical therapies, and exercise for acute and chronic nonsurgical low back pain. Spinal manipulation has undergone a resurgence of interest. Developing evidence suggests a relationship between safety, skill and clinical outcome. Training programs are variable and range from extensive formalized curricula to weekend seminars and individual demonstrations. Systematic study of a relationship between prerequisites and skill development has not been conducted. The literature often refers to a recent rise in occupational low back pain. However, the question is: Do empirical data support this notion? To determine whether patients with age related macular degeneration (ARMD) benefit from cataract surgery in terms of visual function and quality of life measures, and to assess the impact of surgery on the progression of ARMD. To assess the benefits of cataract extraction in patients with age related maculopathy (ARM). Many epidemiological studies indicate a positive correlation between cataract surgery and the subsequent progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Such a correlation would have far-reaching consequences. However, in epidemiological studies it is difficult to determine the significance of a single risk factor, such as cataract surgery.

Despite advances in pain research, many patients still experience moderate to severe post-operative pain that needs to be alleviated. The primary aim of this study was to identify predictive factors for severe post-operative pain after thoracotomy. Secondary, we investigated the levels of post-operative pain in this group of patients. Chronic postthoracotomy pain is a significant adverse outcome of thoracic surgery. We evaluated with a prospective randomized trial the effect of a multimodal no-compression suture technique of the intercostal space on postoperative pain occurrence in patients undergoing minithoracotomy. A prospective longitudinal study with 144 patients scheduled for thoracotomy was conducted between December 2007 and August 2010. All patients were given a questionnaire consisting of three sections (Brief Pain Inventory, Life Orientation Test-revised and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) the day before surgery. Only those patients with pre-existing chronic pain were asked to complete all three sections. Post-operative pain scores were recorded three times a day for 6 days using the Numeric Rating Scale, and all analgesic consumption was recorded daily. The purpose of this study was to identify the preoperative determinants of severe postoperative pain. Patients' postoperative pain experience can be assessed on the basis of their usage of patient-controlled analgesia. In a prospective trial the daily self-administered doses of analgesics in 144 patients scheduled for thoracotomy were compared with the daily doses of analgesics prescribed by the physician.

Context: Functional outcomes after knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain poor. The ability to restore the soft tissue envelope intraoperatively may improve such outcomes. The aim of this study was to extend the scope of computer navigation as a tool to quantifying the envelope of laxity during subjective stress testing preoperatively and to quantify the effects of knee replacement and how it changes as a result of ligamentous failure. Loaded cadaveric legs were mounted on a purpose-built rig. Envelope of laxity was measured in 3 degrees of freedom using computer navigation. Knees were subjectively stressed in varus/valgus, internal/external rotation and anterior draw. This was performed preoperatively, during TKA and after sequential sectioning of ligaments. Real-time data were recorded at 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° of flexion. Mixed effect modelling was used to quantify the effects of intervention on degree of laxity. Rotatory knee laxity was retrospectively analysed in 42 patients, including two different ACL reconstructions. The maximal anterior displacement and the absolute value of the posterior acceleration reached during the reduction of the tibial lateral compartment were intra-operatively acquired by using a navigation system and identified as discriminating parameters. For each parameter, statistical linear regression analysis (line slope and intercept) was performed between pre- and post-reconstruction values.

Context: In this study, we aimed to establish whether first-trimester β-hCG and PAPP-A levels were predictive of fetal compromise in labour and whether these first-trimester markers could be correlated with fetal haemodynamics at term in a low-risk population. The serum levels of βhCG were significantly higher in pregnancies which subsequently developed preeclampsia. The PAPP-A concentration did not differ significantly in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia than in uncomplicated pregnancies. To examine the role of first-trimester uterine artery Doppler, serum β-hCG and pregnancy-associated placental protein-A (PAPP-A) in prediction of preeclampsia and IUGR.

Context: The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied. Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions. The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations. The first study included 151 college students; the second included 121 psychiatric inpatients. Bootstrapping-enhanced mediation analyses were utilized to assess associations between self-reports of emotion-regulation skills and psychopathology, as well as potential mediation effects. College students (N = 158) completed measures of psychopathology symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and social functioning. The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied. Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions.

To explore three questions: 1) Do chronic stressors predict physiological dysregulation? 2) Is that relationship moderated by characteristics of the individual and his or her social environment? and 3) Do perceived levels of stress mediate the relationship between stressors and dysregulation? We find a positive association between the number of stressors and physiological dysregulation. The results indicate that this relationship is stronger for persons with greater psychosocial vulnerability, but even so, the magnitude of the effect remains modest. We find some evidence that the level of perceived stress mediates the relationship between chronic stressors and physiological dysregulation. The allostatic load framework implies that cumulative exposure to stressors results in multi-system physiological dysregulation. Data come from a nationally representative, longitudinal study of older Taiwanese (n = 916).

166,Do people with dementia find lies and deception in dementia care acceptable?,"Q: Do people with dementia find lies and deception in dementia care acceptable?
Context: Research suggests that the use of lies and deception are prevalent in dementia care settings. This issue has been explored from the view point of carers and professionals, and the acceptability and ethicality of deception in dementia care remains an area of heated debate. This article explored the issue of lies and deception in dementia care from the unique perspective of the people being lied to: People with Dementia. Lies were considered to be acceptable if told in People with Dementia's best interest. This best interest decision was complex, and influenced by factors such as the person with dementia's awareness of the lie, and the carer's motivation for lying. A model depicting these factors is discussed. Eighty-two carers of dementia sufferers were interviewed in their homes about three types of abuse (verbal abuse, physical abuse and neglect) using a structured questionnaire. The information gathered provided a rich understanding of the frailty, dependency and unpredictable behaviour of people living with some form of dementia and how that creates tensions in a place that is environmentally, culturally and resourcefully bereft of what is required for truly effective care. When the sexual relationship involved a PWD and a cognitively intact resident, participants tended to define the situation as real (54.7%) or possible (35.8%) abuse, whereas when both parties had dementia it was more frequently conceptualized as a possibly abusive (39.6%) or non-abusive (37.7%) situation. The most frequent reaction to both situations was seeking the advice of other professionals. Research suggests that the use of lies and deception are prevalent in dementia care settings.

Context: Title: Critical care response to a hospital outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection in Shenzhen, China
Passage: 2019-nCoV patients should be admitted to singlebedded, negative pressure rooms in isolated units with intensive care and monitoring . Clinical engineering should have plans to reconstruct standard rooms . Retrofitting the rooms with externally exhausted HEPA filters may be an expedient solution. Also, the general hospital may consider procedures such as suspending elective surgeries, canceling ambulatory clinics and outpatient diagnostic procedures, transferring patients to other institutions, and restricting hospital visitors . More importantly, because the hospitals' ability to respond to the outbreak largely depends on their available ICU beds, the plan to increase ICU bed capacity needs to be determined. Title: Critical care response to a hospital outbreak of the 2019-nCoV infection in Shenzhen, China
Passage: > 3 weeks according to some literature and our unpublished data . Healthcare providers and those in contact with infected patients should utilize contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with N95 respirator. Strict infection prevention and control practices have been implemented and audited in our units following the infection prevention and control plan published by China's National Health Committee . In addition, wellequipped fever clinic as triage station with trained staff knowing 2019-nCoV case definitions is established.

Passage: and DR examination rooms, should be implemented properly. Early operative control of hemorrhage is the key to saving the lives of severe trauma patients. We investigated whether emergency room (ER) stay time [time from the ER to the operating room (OR)] is associated with trauma severity and unexpected trauma death [Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS) method-based probability of survival (Ps) ≥0.5 but died]of injured patients needing emergency trauma surgery. Thirty percent of trauma admissions underwent operative intervention, with 57% of these requiring emergent surgery.

Context: Title: Asthma in the elderly: what we know and what we have yet to know
Passage: Whereas younger patients with asthma often suffer from allergic rhinitis complaints, elderly patients with asthma often suffer from sinus symptoms, including nasal obstruction, loss of smell and facial pain/headache. A recent Europe-wide epidemiologic study on the prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis did confirm the well-known association between allergic rhinitis and early-onset asthma, but also demonstrated a clear increased risk to suffer from late-onset asthma in CRS patients . CRS may be phenotyped as CRS without and with nasal polyps , based on symptoms , nasal endoscopy and CT scanning. From those phenotypes, CRSwNP has a clearly increased risk of asthma comorbidity Title: Respiratory Viral Infections in Exacerbation of Chronic Airway Inflammatory Diseases: Novel Mechanisms and Insights From the Upper Airway Epithelium
Passage: Additionally, in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp , viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP . Increased eosinophilia, in turn, worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties. On the other hand, patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp are more neutrophilic in Title: Asthma in the elderly: what we know and what we have yet to know
Passage: With regard to this, recent evidence indicates the potential roles of chronic rhinosinusitis in the asthma pathogenesis. The GA2LEN surveys found that late-onset adult asthma was independently associated with CRS irrespective of nasal allergies . Recent endotype approaches suggest the specific roles of Staphylococcal enterotoxin sensitization in the pathogenesis of CRS subtypes with nasal polyp and severe late-onset non-atopic adult asthma . These findings may also be quite relevant to the elderly population, as elderly asthma is a considerably late-onset disease. Title: Asthma in the elderly: what we know and what we have yet to know

Passage: Otolaryngologists should also monitor for chronic rhinosinusitis in PCD patients.

Passage: their ability to pose ongoing spillover risk to humans. Tradeoffs among competing traits are believed to be crucial to the maintenance of diversity in complex communities. The production of antibiotics to inhibit competitors and resistance to antibiotic inhibition are two traits hypothesized to be critical to microbial fitness in natural habitats, yet data on costs or tradeoffs associated with these traits are limited. In this work we characterized tradeoffs between antibiotic inhibition or resistance capacities and growth efficiencies or niche widths for a broad collection of Streptomyces from soil. Streptomyces isolates tended to have either very little or very high inhibitory capacity. In contrast, Streptomyces isolates were most commonly resistant to antibiotic inhibition by an intermediate number of other isolates. Streptomyces with either very high antibiotic inhibitory or resistance capacities had less efficient growth and utilized a smaller number of resources for growth (smaller niche width) than those with low inhibition or resistance capacities, suggesting tradeoffs between antibiotic inhibitory or resistance and resource use phenotypes. We measured the relative contribution of oxidative stress by recording the percentage of single nucleotide substitutions reported in the genes rpoB and pncA that confer resistance to the antimicrobials rifampicin and pyrazinamide, respectively, and determined whether there is an excess of G?C-->T?A or G?C-->A?T substitutions. Twelve coagulase-negative staphylococci and three Staphylococcus aureus isolates showed five different patterns of resistance on the basis of their sensitivity to oxacillin, three aminoglycosides, and vancomycin. Six of the synergy tests showed a considerable synergistic effect, with an average three-fold reduction in the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the two antibiotics used to treat the patients. No antagonistic effects were noted, and the combined antibiotics showed an overall clinical effectiveness of 91.7%. The rate of in vitro growth inhibition of the three isolates was 1.2-fold higher than that of the control strain.

It is well known that the abundance of Fe suppresses defense system leading host vulnerable to infections. There is a significant relationship between Hepcidin, Fe metabolism, inflammation, and the immune system.

It is produced by the liver as a firstline response to inflammatory reactions and high Fe concentrations . Hepcidin plays a fundamental role in the regulation of Fe metabolism , which is a part of foundational cellular functions and thus of vital importance. On the other hand, by participating in redox reactions leading to the production of reactive oxygen species , Fe also causes oxidative stress. Therefore, Fe has been regarded as a potentially toxic element to cells . Fe also plays an', 'Title: Silencing airway epithelial cell-derived hepcidin exacerbates sepsis-induced acute lung injury\nPassage: Hepcidin regulates iron metabolism by binding to ferroportin and causing its internalization and degradation. We therefore investigated the ferroportin levels in both whole lung tissue and alveolar macrophages.

The increase in tissue and plasma Fe levels stimulates the synthesis of hepcidin and reduces Fe release and enteric Fe absorption from macrophages and hepatocytes . Increased hepcidin concentrations during inflammation and infection reduce serum Fe levels by decreasing Fe release from macrophages and hepatocytes, and thus Fe required for microorganisms and tumor cells is restricted .', ""Bdelloid rotifers are the most common and abundant group of animals that reproduce by ameiotic parthenogenesis, only.

Context: Previous research has shown a positive relationship between activity-related social support provided by parents and peers and adolescents' physical activity. However, more information is needed on whether activity-related social support differs by sociodemographic characteristics. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in activity-related social support in a sample of adolescents, by characteristics such as age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), ethnicity, and physical activity level and to determine which characteristics are the most important predictors of activity-related social support. Boys, White British, younger, more physically active, and high-SES adolescents perceived more support for physical activity. Age predicted all types of support excluding peer support; ethnicity predicted mother logistic support and sibling support; gender predicted peer support, father explicit modeling, and father logistic support; and SES predicted mother and father logistic support. Using the social cognitive theory, this study aims to examine how gender moderates the direct and indirect relationships of various sources of social support on Chinese adolescents' physical activity (PA). Social (2.53; 0.38) and active-physical activities were most preferred (2.10; 0.42), and self-improvement activities were least preferred (1.93; 0.49). Preference for certain activities was not strongly associated with actual involvement in these activities. Family activity-orientation, family expressiveness, and adolescent's motivation explained 15% of the variance in preferences for social activities, and 37% of the variance in preferences for self-improvement activities.

Previous studies reported lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores in overweight and obese adolescents compared to their normal weight counterparts; however, few studies investigated the association between obesity-related behaviors including physical activity and sedentary behaviors and HRQOL in adolescents. This study aimed at investigating the relationship between physical activity, sedentary behaviors, sleep duration and body mass index-for-age (BMI-for-age) and HRQOL among high school Tehranian students. Over one third of students (38.5 %) were either overweight or obese. The means of all self- and parent-reported HRQOL scores were significantly lower in girls, compared to boys, except for the parent-reported social functioning subscale. Mean hours of daily sleeping were significantly higher in girls, compared to boys (8.16 ± 1.27 vs. 7.73 ± 1.22 respectively; p<0.05). Both girls and boys spent more time on sedentary activities than engaging in sport activities. During school and vacation periods, boys had significantly higher daily energy expenditure (DEE) compared to girls (p<0.05). Only DEE during school period had a significant inverse correlation with BMI-for-age in boys but not girls (r = -0.14, p<0.05).

Passage: groups who are vulnerable because of social disadvantage. Nor does it note the need for explicit attention to vulnerable social subgroups, for example, low-wage workers in prioritized occupational fi elds and low-income and minority pregnant women, infants, and toddlers. We are not questioning the rationality of defi ning major priority groups according to occupation or of using biological criteria to further prioritize within the general population.

179,Is administration of preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors important for renal protection after cardiac surgery?,"Q: Is administration of preoperative angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors important for renal protection after cardiac surgery?
Context: Recent reports indicate increased risk of renal failure with long-term use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in diabetes. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) in diabetes has increased despite ACEI and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use. This study questions renal protection by ACEI or ARB. Our hypothesis is that uncontrolled hyperglycemia is central to diabetic ESRD while tight glucose control is renoprotective. Cultured endothelial cells show morphological damage that increases with duration of exposure to high glucose and is prevented by insulin and more so by a combination of insulin and heparin. Activation of the renal renin-angiotensin system in patients with diabetes mellitus appears to contribute to the risk of nephropathy. Recently, it has been recognized than an elevation of prorenin in plasma also provides a strong indication of risk of nephropathy. This study was designed to examine renin-angiotensin system control mechanisms in the patient with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are the first-line treatment for diabetic patients with hypertension. However, whether RAS inhibitors prevent the development of DKD remains controversial. We conducted a retrospective cohort study quantifying the preventive effect of antihypertensive treatment with RAS inhibitors on DKD, using data from specific health check-ups and health insurance claims. To determine how effective angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors must be in preventing diabetic nephropathy to warrant early and routine therapy in all Pima Indians with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Reducing the actions of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) slows nephropathy progression in patients with or without diabetes. Post hoc analyses of many ACEI-based clinical trials demonstrate the greatest slowing of renal disease progression in patients with the greatest degree of renal insufficiency at study initiation. However, many physicians fail to use ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with renal insufficiency for fear that either serum creatinine or potassium levels will rise.

Context: We have previously observed that prescription of some antidepressant class drugs (particularly the SSRIs) is associated with attenuation of the number, duration and severity of both high and low mood states in those with Bipolar II Disorder. We examined whether SSRIs are a mood stabilizer for Bipolar II Disorder. 57 SA outpatients (DSM-IV) were diagnosed and naturalistic efficacious treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Their demographic, clinical features and therapeutic response were compared with 41 DSM-IV bipolar II patients in their starting evaluations in our outpatient clinic in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The treatment of bipolar disorders with mood stabilizing agents is complicated by breakthrough episodes of depression. Currently there are no consistently safe and effective medications for these episodes. The authors address the use of bupropion for this purpose. The role of antidepressants in treating bipolar disorder is controversial, and the comparative effectiveness of specific drugs is insufficiently studied.We report here a comparison of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (PAROX).

Context: The optimal management of patients with ureteric obstruction in advanced pelvic malignancy is unclear. Effective judgment is required to decide which patients would benefit most from decompression of the urinary tract. The objective of our study was to assess survival and complication rates post-percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) in patients with ureteric obstruction due to advanced pelvic malignancy. We performed successful subcutaneous urinary diversion in 2 patients with malignant, metastatic periureteral obstruction. Both patients had previously been managed with a chronic percutaneous nephrostomy that was both painful and inconvenient. The nephrovesical stent was inserted utilizing percutaneous access to both the kidney and bladder followed by creation of a subcutaneous tunnel between the two sites. To compare the complications and morbidities after placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube or an internal ureteral stent (IUS) in the management of malignant ureteral obstruction in patients with advanced malignancy. The use of external percutaneous nephrostomy drainage in patients with end-stage ureteral obstruction in whom ureteral stenting has failed presents significant compromises in the patient's quality of life. Toward this end, we present the initial experience in the United States with an intracorporeal nephrovesical stent. The records of all patients who underwent surgery for ureteropelvic junction obstruction from August 1985 to October 1998 and were treated only with a nephrostomy tube after pyeloplasty were reviewed for hospital course, complications and postoperative followup. All patients had a perinephric Penrose drain as well as a Foley catheter placed for bladder drainage.

Context: Vancomycin is used widely as empiric therapy for gram-positive organisms in patients with an intra-abdominal infection (IAI), even in those with no history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection or colonization. Potential adverse effects of vancomycin include nephrotoxicity, increased cost, and bacterial resistance. We hypothesized that MRSA nasal screening could be used to predict patients with a MRSA IAI and used to avoid unnecessary empiric vancomycin use. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are becoming an increasing problem, but the link with symptomatic sino-nasal infection has not previously been quantified. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in patients undergoing sino-nasal surgery. To test the hypothesis that methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) carriage may protect against nosocomial methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) acquisition by competing for colonization of the anterior nares. To determine the cost-effectiveness of a policy of screening high-risk patients for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization on admission to hospital. After the implementation of an active surveillance programme for MRSA in US Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers, there was an increase in vancomycin use. We investigated whether positive MRSA admission surveillance tests were associated with MRSA-positive clinical admission cultures and whether the availability of surveillance tests influenced prescribers' ability to match initial anti-MRSA antibiotic use with anticipated MRSA results from clinical admission cultures.

Hydrocephalus secondary to tuberculous meningitis (TBM) continues to be a challenging condition to treat for neurosurgeons in developing countries.

We compared the CSF composition of 53 patients who had shunt malfunction during a five year period with that of 137 matched controls. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is the current mainstay of treatment for children with tuberculous meningitis with hydrocephalus. However, ventriculoperitoneal shunting is highly associated with complications, and more importantly, long-term, indwelling shunt devices may adversely affect children's spirits and psychological health. Therefore, there is clearly a need to explore methods of CSF diversion to avoid ventriculoperitoneal shunting. Patients who had shunt malfunction had a significantly higher concentration of CSF protein.

We aim to present a case of CCSVI in a patient with MS caused by bilateral IJV inverted valves combined with IJV external compression by carotid bulb.', 'A 31-year-old female patient was admitted to our institute for IJV and vertebral veins morphological and haemodynamical assessment after being treated for MS for the last 14 years. Colour Doppler ultrasonography showed right IJV prestenotic dilation and inverted valves in both IJV. Computerized tomography angiography showed bilateral IJV compression by carotid bulb. Haemodynamical Doppler parameters showed that external IJV compression significantly contributed to CCSVI occurrence.', 'The study included 62 subjects with a definitive diagnosis of MS and 54 control subjects. The cross sectional area (CSA), reflux during Valsalva manoeuvre, presence or absence of flow in the internal jugular vein (IJV) were assessed in upright and supine positions. The IJV and vertebral vein (VV) flow volumes (BFV) were also studied.', 'We prospectively recruited 100 patients without MS, aged 18-60 years, referred for contrast-enhanced MRI. They underwent additional CE-MRV from skull base to mediastinum on a 3T scanner. Exclusion criteria included prior neck radiation, neck surgery, neck/mediastinal masses or significant cardiac or pulmonary disease. Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated the studies to document asymmetry and stenosis in the jugular veins and prominence of collateral veins.', 'Reflux in the IJV, an upright CSA greater than a supine CSA, and the presence or absence of flow in the IJV were not different between MS and control subjects. A CSA ≤ 0.3 cm(2) was observed to be significantly higher in MS subjects. The IJV BFV was not significantly different between the groups; however, the VV BFV was significantly higher on the right side and lower on the left side in MS subjects.', 'During surgery for endometrial cancer, a pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy is performed at least in patients with risk factors (stage I, grading 2 and/or histological subtypes with higher risk of lymphatic spread), and is hence recommended by the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO). Although lymph node metastases are important prognostic parameters, it has been contentious whether a pelvic lymph node dissection itself has a prognostic impact in the treatment of endometrial cancer, especially in endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Therefore, this study evaluated whether lymphadenectomy has a prognostic impact in patients with endometrioid adenocarcinoma.', 'Patients with endometrial cancer can present with various complicating illnesses, including obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and advanced aging. These patients are at high risk of severe post-operative complications. Thus, the question of whether or not to perform systemic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains controversial for all patients. It is reported that external iliac lymph nodes are the most commonly involved lymph nodes in endometrial cancer, and para-aortic lymph node (PAN) metastases spread via a route shared by the common iliac lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of omitting PAN dissection when metastasis of the common iliac and external iliac lymph nodes is negative.', 'The 2010 guidelines of the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) classify patients with endometrial cancer into three risk groups for lymph node invasion and recurrence on the basis of MRI and histological analysis of an endometrial specimen obtained preoperatively. The classification guides therapeutic choices, which may include pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of preoperative assessment to help identify intermediate- or high-risk patients requiring lymphadenectomy.', 'To evaluate the potential benefits of systemic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy in endometrioid uterine cancer patients.', 'Determination of early disease recurrence in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer operated laparoscopically without pelvic or paraaortic lymphadenectomy.']"

Ursodeoxycholic acid is frequently used in cholestatic liver diseases. Also, it protects hepatocytes against oxidative stress induced by hydrophobic bile acids. We investigated the anti-oxidative effect of ursodeoxycholic acid on ischemia/reperfusion injury after ovarian de-torsion in rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective activity of sildenafil treatment against ischemia-reperfusion damage created experimentally in rat ovaries. The beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids on an intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) model was shown previously. Therefore, we aimed to examine the potential beneficial effects of parenteral omega-3 fatty acids, a safe and inexpensive product, on a rat model of ovarian I/R. Intestinal ischemic injury is exacerbated by reperfusion in rodent and feline models because of xanthine oxidase-initiated reactive oxygen metabolite formation and neutrophil infiltration. Studies were conducted to determine the relevance of reperfusion injury in the juvenile pig, whose low levels of xanthine oxidase are similar to those of the human being.

187,Does first episode polarity predict risk for suicide attempt in bipolar disorder?,"Q: Does first episode polarity predict risk for suicide attempt in bipolar disorder?
Context: Sri Lanka has a high suicide rate. The importance of suicidal ideations and their relationship to the common mental disorders (CMD) have not been adequately explored. This study examined whether patients harboring suicidal thoughts or life weariness would volunteer them. It also examined the relationship between life weariness, suicidal ideations, and the probability of underlying CMD. Systematic cross-sectional clinical data on suicidal ideation, socio-demographic variables, psychiatric status, social adjustment, status and history of addiction in 616 patients were gathered. Patients' self-report of their primary care physician asking them: (1) whether they had been feeling sad, blue, or depressed; (2) to fill out a questionnaire about their mood or feelings; and (3) whether they had been thinking about death or suicide. To determine whether patients who disclosed suicidal ideation during a health-risk survey had their mental health symptoms documented by physicians and were given mental health referrals and to evaluate how many of these patients subsequently attempted suicide. As part of an instrument validation study, ED patients (10-21 years old) with both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric presenting complaints were recruited to take part in suicide screening. Clinically significant suicidal thoughts, as measured by the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire, and suicidal behaviors were assessed, as well as patient opinions about suicide screening. Recruitment rates for the study as well as impact on length of stay were assessed. Sri Lanka has a high suicide rate.

Recruitment rates for the study as well as impact on length of stay were assessed. To test whether children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), free of conduct disorder (CD) in childhood (mean = 8 years), have elevated risk-taking, accidents, and medical illnesses in adulthood (mean = 41 years); whether development of CD influences risk-taking during adulthood; and whether exposure to psychostimulants in childhood predicts cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized positive relationships between childhood ADHD and risky driving (in the past 5 years), risky sex (in the past year), and between risk-taking and medical conditions in adulthood; and that development of CD/antisocial personality (APD) would account for the link between ADHD and risk-taking. We report causes of death. In adulthood, probands had relatively more risky driving, sexually transmitted disease, head injury, and emergency department admissions (p<.05-.01). Groups did not differ on other medical outcomes. Lifetime risk-taking was associated with negative health outcomes (p = .01-.001). Development of CD/APD accounted for the relationship between ADHD and risk-taking. Probands without CD/APD did not differ from comparison subjects in lifetime risky behaviors. Psychostimulant treatment did not predict cardiac illness (p = .55). Probands had more deaths not related to specific medical conditions (p = .01). This study's primary aim was to examine whether the positive self-perceptual bias present in many youth with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Hoza et al., 2004; Hoza, Pelham, Dobbs, Owens,&Pillow, 2002) mediates the relation of childhood ADHD status to later risky behaviors. Using a subset of children with ADHD and comparison children (n = 645) from the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With ADHD, we predicted that a positive bias in childhood would partially or fully mediate the relation between having ADHD and risky driving and sexual behaviors 8 years later. We studied 409 children who had been followed-up in pediatric allergy clinics and 157 age-matched healthy controls.

The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between the ability to recognize brand logos featured in promotional campaigns of the food industry and eating behaviours, food knowledge and preferences in children aged 9-11 attending six primary schools in Birmingham, West Midlands. A '20 flashcard' brand logo quiz assessed children's brand logo recognition ability; a self-completed questionnaire collected information on children's socio-demographic characteristics, eating behaviours, food knowledge and preferences (n=476). Children demonstrated both high brand logo recognition abilities with 88.4% (420/476) recognizing at least 16/20 brand logos in the quiz and high levels of poor diet. No strong correlation was found between higher brand logo recognition ability and poorer eating behaviours, food knowledge and preferences.

Policy documents in many countries suggest that variations in access contribute to inequalities in diet and in health. Some studies, mostly in the USA, have found that proximity to food stores is associated with dietary patterns, body weight and socio-economic differences in diet and obesity, whilst others have found no such relationships. We aim to investigate whether proximity to food retail stores is associated with dietary patterns or Body Mass Index in Glasgow, a large city in the UK. We mapped data from a 'Health and Well-Being Survey' (n = 991), and a list of food stores (n = 741) in Glasgow City, using ArcGIS, and undertook network analysis to find the distance from respondents' home addresses to the nearest fruit and vegetable store, small general store, and supermarket. We found few statistically significant associations between proximity to food retail outlets and diet or obesity, for unadjusted or adjusted models, or when stratifying by gender, car ownership or employment. This study examined associations between distance to primary food store, fruit and vegetable consumption, and BMI and whether mode of transportation to the primary food store moderates this relation. Supermarket location data from Glasgow, UK (n = 119), and fruit and vegetable intake data from the 'Health and Well-Being' Survey (n = 1041) were used to compare various measures of locational access. These exposure variables included proximity estimates (with different points-of-origin used to vary levels of aggregation) and density measures using three approaches (Euclidean and road network buffers and Kernel density estimation) at distances ranging from 0.4 km to 5 km. Further analysis was conducted to assess the impact of using smaller buffer sizes for individuals who did not own a car. Associations between these multiple access measures and fruit and vegetable consumption were estimated using linear regression models.

189,Do Americans Understand That Global Warming Is Harmful to Human Health?,"Q: Do Americans Understand That Global Warming Is Harmful to Human Health?
Context: Climate change has been described as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. Typically framed as an environmental issue, some suggest this view has contributed to public ambivalence and hence a lack of public engagement. The lack of understanding of climate change as a significant environmental health risk on the part of the lay public represents a significant barrier to behaviour change. We therefore need to think about reframing the impact of climate change from an environmental to a health issue. This paper builds on calls for increased understanding of the public's views of human health risks associated with climate change, focusing on facilitators and barriers to behaviour change. Climate changes and environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic activities are having an irrefutable impact on human health. The critical role played by health promotion in addressing environmental challenges has a history in seminal charters--such as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion--that explicitly link human well-being with the natural environment. The lack of documented practice in this field prompted an investigation of health promotion practice that addresses climate change issues within health care settings. To assess the extent that the health consequences of global warming and the responses to it take due account of its impact on poverty and inequality. Results indicate that the majority of participants were aware of climate change but not of its potential health impacts. Despite this, most planners were of the opinion that they would need to plan for the health impacts of climate change on the community. To date, too little attention has been paid to the health consequences arising from the increased poverty and inequality that global warming will bring. When these are combined with issues arising from the economic melt-down, food shortages, peak oil, etc. we are heading for a global public health crisis of immeasurable magnitude.

Context: To assess the relation between immediate postoperative right ventricular (RV) diastolic physiology and subsequent diastolic function in patients after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Follow-up after tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) repair is directed to detect timely right ventricular (RV) dysfunction by following pulmonary regurgitation and global RV size, with little attention for the effective contribution of regional RV dysfunction. This study investigates the contribution of regional RV dysfunction on exercise capacity after ToF repair. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that limited (<1 cm) right ventriculotomy (RV-tomy) in the setting of transannular tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair might result in less right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction compared with conventional RV-tomy. Novel echocardiographic techniques based on myocardial deformation have not been extensively evaluated to assess right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) response after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot.

We asked, in a group of pediatric patients with acetabular dysplasia who underwent Salter osteotomy, whether the operated hip developed (1) acetabular retroversion compared with contralateral unaffected hips; (2) radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis; or (3) worse functional scores. (4) In addition, we asked whether femoral head deformity resulting from aseptic necrosis was a risk factor for acetabular retroversion. We compared 40 hips in 36 patients treated with a Pemberton osteotomy (Pemberton group) and 30 hips in 26 patients treated only with a Pavlik harness (Rb group) for developmental dysplasia of the hip. The average age at operation in the Pemberton group was 94.5 months and the follow-up duration was 151.8 months. Radiographic parameters included the acetabular index (α angle) and the center-edge angle of Wiberg, preoperatively and at skeletal maturity. We examined the crossover sign (COS) at the latest follow-up as a sign of acetabular retroversion (AR). We compared the parameters between the two groups and examined the risk factors for acetabular retroversion using a multivariate Cox model. The purpose of this study was to investigate residual acetabular retroversion after skeletal maturity in patients with Pemberton osteotomy. The occurrence of exaggerated femoral anteversion and the role of femoral derotation osteotomy in developmental dysplasia of hip, especially early walking age group are controversial. The success of Bernese periacetabular osteotomy depends significantly on how extent the acetabular fragment can be corrected to its optimal position.

Context: Atrial infarction reportedly occurs in 0.7% to 52% of ST-elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs), up to two thirds of whom develop atrial fibrillation and flutter (AF). Prospective validation of electrocardiographic atrial infarction patterns is lacking. Hence, in STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, we examined whether baseline atrial electrocardiographic changes or atrial infarction patterns predicted new AF or mortality. Unlike in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, there has been no systematic study on the role of the pre-excitation pattern in predicting the ablation site in patients with atriofascicular (AF) pathways. We assessed in a large cohort the value of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during antidromic tachycardia (ADT) to predict the site of ablation. We sought to investigate whether, in humans, the timing and incidence of a relapse of atrial fibrillation (AF) during the first month after cardioversion indicates the presence of electrical remodeling and whether this could be influenced by prevention of intracellular calcium overload during AF. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased mortality and a higher complication rate postmyocardial infarction (MI), but the exact mechanisms are unknown. We investigated whether AF predisposes to ventricular arrhythmia in postmyocardial infarct patients, thereby accounting for increased mortality. Postoperative atrial fibrillation is common after cardiac surgery. In this study, we aimed to investigate the value of interatrial conduction time for the prediction of early postoperative atrial fibrillation, using intra-operative transoesophageal echocardiography.

193,Should surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation be performed in patients with a significantly enlarged left atrium?,"Q: Should surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation be performed in patients with a significantly enlarged left atrium?
Context: In patients with pulmonary dysfunction, it is unclear whether a less-invasive approach for aortic valve replacement is well tolerated or even beneficial. We investigated whether a partial upper J-incision for aortic valve replacement leads to more favorable outcomes than a full sternotomy in patients with chronic lung disease by using forced expiratory volume in 1 second as a surrogate. The question whether the aortic valve in patients with mild aortic stenosis undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) should be replaced or left alone is still controversial. Recently, bicuspid aortic valve disease is posed to be a possible risk factor for dilatation of the pulmonary autograft. Aortic valve replacement for bioprosthesis dysfunction is a procedure involving considerable risk. In some cases, mortality is high and may contraindicate the procedure. Minimally invasive transcatheter aortic ""valve-in-valve"" implant appears to be an alternative, reducing morbidity and mortality. The objective is to evaluate aortic valve-in-valve procedure using Braile Inovare prosthesis. There is the potential for left ventricular outflow obstruction when small aortic valve bioprostheses are employed in normal-sized or large adults. It has been hoped that bovine pericardial valves would improve hemodynamic performance in the smaller tissue valve sizes.

Context: Helicobacter pylori is thought to be involved in atrophic body gastritis. We explored the prevalence of H. pylori infection in asymptomatic subjects with gastric parietal cell antibodies, as well as in patients with pernicious anemia, to evaluate a possible role of H. pylori gastric infection in gastric autoimmunity. Helicobacter pylori-associated corpus atrophy and autoimmune gastric atrophy share similar histopathologic and clinical aspects. In our study, the relation between Helicobacter pylori and autoimmune gastritis was investigated. Are there connections between Helicobacter pylori-induced and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal mucosal lesions leading to an increased risk? Are there any diagnostic or therapeutic consequences? Helicobacter pylori infection is a key risk factor for chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), an established precursor of gastric cancer. There is increasing evidence of frequent clearance of the infection during progression of CAG. We aimed to assess the association between host inflammatory polymorphisms and H. pylori seropositivity among CAG patients from Germany. Infection with Helicobacter pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer. Several studies have indicated that the association differs with strain type. We aimed to find out if infection with strains lacking the virulence factor CagA is linked to gastric cancer risk. Helicobacter pylori is thought to be involved in atrophic body gastritis.

Context: To examine the willingness of grown-ups with congenital heart disease (GUCH) to participate in the GUCH Training Program-Individualised (GTI), an exercise program specifically designed for GUCH, and to identify factors affecting their willingness to participate. Patients with established heart disease referred for participation in a comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program. Many patients with congenital heart disease do not meet current public health guidelines to participate in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity for ≥60 minutes per day. They are less fit than their healthy peers. We hypothesized that exercise training would increase cardiopulmonary fitness and daily physical activity in these patients. We therefore assessed effects of an exercise training program on cardiopulmonary fitness and daily physical activity in patients with corrected tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) or Fontan circulation. To explore whether the severity of congenital heart disease is associated with the quality of life and perceived health status of adult patients. A total of 14 children, 8-12 years, with Fontan circulation enrolled in a 12-week moderate/high intensity home-based cardiac physical activity program, which included a home exercise routine and 3 formalized in-person exercise sessions at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. Subjects and parents completed validated questionnaires to assess HRQOL. The Shuttle Test Run was used to measure exercise capacity.

196,Hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does gracilis tendon harvest matter?,"Q: Hamstring tendon anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: does gracilis tendon harvest matter?
Context: Hamstring tendon grafts are a popular choice for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Typical morbidity reported after hamstring tendon harvest is muscle weakness in flexion, and whilst still a matter for debate, this morbidity may be greater if the gracilis tendon is harvested in addition to the semitendinosus.                 This study sought to comprehensively compare the outcome of ACL reconstructions in which the semitendinosus was harvested alone (ST group) or with the gracilis (ST/G group). A growing body of evidence indicates that in patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with a combined semitendinosus and gracilis (STGR) graft there are large deficits in the internal rotation strength, which has led some authors to recommend harvest of only ST tendon whenever possible. The purpose of this study was to assess the isometric (IT) and peak torque (PT) of the muscles responsible for shin rotation in patients after ACLR with an ST or with an STGR graft. Hamstring tendons are commonly used as a graft source for ACL reconstruction. This study seeks to determine whether either the diameter of the tendon graft or the age of the patient influences the outcome of the ACL reconstruction when measured using a standard, previously validated laxity measurement device. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference in the clinical results of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction when using the semitendinosus tendon (ST) alone versus the semitendinosus and gracilis (STG) construct.

However, there is insufficient information regarding patient outcomes after surgery, such as the frequency of unplanned hospital readmissions and factors contributing to readmission.QUESTIONS/', 'The most frequent indications for anatomic shoulder replacement are glenohumeral osteoarthritis and fractures of the humeral head. If anatomic shoulder prostheses fail, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is often the only remaining treatment option. This study evaluates the influence of indications for primary shoulder arthroplasty on the clinical outcome after conversion to reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.']"

To compare stereo digital images with stereo 35-mm color transparencies as to the quality and reliability of grading age-related maculopathy (ARM) in the context of a multicenter European epidemiologic study (the EUREYE Study). Grading of photographs for nuclear sclerosis, cortical cataract, and posterior subcapsular cataract and signs of age-related maculopathy was performed using standardized protocols. Are existing systematic reviews of interventions for age-related macular degeneration incorporated into clinical practice guidelines? Photographs were graded by protocol for the presence and severity of age-related lens opacities. Diabetics referred for screening were studied in a prospective fashion. A single 45 degrees fundus image was obtained using the nonmydriatic digital camera. Each patient subsequently underwent slit-lamp biomicroscopy and diabetic retinopathy grading by a consultant ophthalmologist. Diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy was graded according to the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study. Wear associated with hip components represents the main clinical problem in these patients, and it is important to develop new techniques for more accurate measurements of that wear. Currently, the gravimetric method is the gold standard for assessing mass measurements in preclinical evaluations. However, this method does not give other information such as volumetric loss or surface deviation. This work aimed to develop and validate a new technique to quantify ceramic volume loss from in vitro experiments using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). We evaluated femoral head coverage by three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction after Pemberton's pericapsular osteotomy with open reduction in cases with developmental dysplasia of the hip. We assessed (1) the risk of fracture when a new ceramic head was placed on a previously implanted trunion; (2) the survival rate of the revised hips; and (3) hip function and acetabular and femoral component loosening at midterm followup. The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of single-photon emission computerized tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) in the clinical assessment of painful knee prostheses. We used micro-CT scans of retrieved total knee liners and unworn, new liners to determine the volume and location of wear.

It has been suggested that hospital admission during weekends poses a risk for adverse outcomes and increased patient mortality, the so-called 'weekend effect'. We undertook an evaluation of the impact of weekend admissions to the management of polytraumatised patients, in a Level I Major Trauma Centre (MTC) in the UK. Many previous studies have shown that patients admitted to hospital at weekends have worse outcomes than those on other days.
