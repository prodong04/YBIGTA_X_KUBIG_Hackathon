# Welcome to the YBIGTA X KUBIG Hackathon!

### In this competition, you'll leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to tackle various challenges. 
#### Below are the steps to set up your project environment:

### Project Setup Instructions

conda create -n hack python=3.10
conda activate hack
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd modules

### Important Notes
1. Python Version: Ensure you're using Python 3.10, as compatibility issues may arise with other versions.

2. Dependency Installation: The requirements.txt file (may...) lists all necessary packages. If you encounter issues during installation, verify the package versions and check your internet connection. If you need some other packages, don't hesitate to install.
